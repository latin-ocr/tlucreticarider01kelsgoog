suppus. -et etc: ‘and on the ground the tumult ol mind which

second; because whatever the nature ot the mind, so long as it remaius
in connection with the body at all, and the body is the means through
which it manifesta itsell, anything that affects the body must affect

¹⁷7· tibi: see n. to r, oya-animus: under this term, Munro
remarks, the poet here includes animo as well, as is cleas from 212
