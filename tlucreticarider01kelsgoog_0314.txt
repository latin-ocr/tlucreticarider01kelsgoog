stand in its regular place as first word ot the clause. In prose, how·
ever, it oiten yields its position to an emphatic word. Cf. 3453 4,
933. ³40· sublima: sublimus was a rare collateral torm of mhlimr's.
Lucr. does not use tbe latter. On the other hand, sublime is the
common iorm oi the adv, and noblimiter is rare. ‘ With the threeiold
division oi the world ci. 278. , 341. multa modis multis: Lucr. is
lond oi this expression, the alliteration and paronomasia oi which
seem to have struck his lancy. The Latins in general showed aiond·
ness ior placing near together words that sounded alike. Ct. A. 344, g ,·
G. 683; H. 563. 343. non . . . priv. carer. eto: i. e. on the
principle that a thing cannot be said to be deprived oi that which it
never possessed-sollicito: with‘the derivational meaning (sollus,
cognate with ὅλος, whole, and citrrs part. oi ciere) ‘wholly in motion,’
‘restless’ So 3, 7323 6, 1038 and 1185. 346 solidae: solutius,
Munro observes, is the technical term ol our poet ior what is ‘⁴ per·
iectly solid and impenetrable, that is, his first-beginnings; in this sense
no res can be solidat See n. to ²23· 347. cum: hardly necessary
here, as the simple abl. oi characteristic would have fully expressed
the meaning. Trans. ‘endowed with,’‘having.' This pleonastic use
oi cum is not uncommon. See Roby, 1881; Madvig, 258. 350.
omne: not ‘every’ nor ‘whole’ but ‘throughout,’ ‘every part ot!
351. Observe the chiasmus; see n. to 22-23.-lundunts Lucr. is
lond oi this word. Ci. 17 5; Cic. De Sen. 14, 51 fundit frugem spici
ordine structam. 352. totas: supply arbores from arduno above.
In 2 53 the use oi arboris is avoided by supplying meae irom preceding

Munro's reading ior possent ; a judicious change. So below 593, 597,

reans and Sceptics ’ ch. 17. 360. glomere: the o, short by nature,
is here made long. 361. par est: ‘itis natural) 3⁶2· deorsum:
scanned de‘orsum. The Epicurean view that matter tends downward
by its own weight is explained 2, 184-215. ³⁶3· inanis: substan-
tive, dep. on natura ,· notura inanis, like notura aquai, mellis, animi,
etc, is somewhat pleonastic. 364. que: ‘and yet,’ mildly adversa·
tive; ause sometimes found in both prose andverse, more frequently
aiter a negative. 365. nimirum: ‘beyond doubt,' emphatic.
This isa lavorite word of Lucr. in introducing a strong assertion.
368. est = existit; emphatic by position.
