notwithstanding Lucullus* popularity‚ the triumph was obtained only
with the greatest difficulty. As praetor in 58 Memmius showed the
same spirit and-courage, which, however, were devoted to purely par·
tisan and selfish ends. Though he bitterly attacked Julius Caesar at
this time, later seeing it would be to his advantage to Join Caesar's
party he shamelessiy went over to it, and accepted the aid oi his
tormer enemy in presenting himself as candidate ior the consulship
in 54. He soon proved faithless to Caesar, and being impeached
ior electiori bribery he leit Rome in disgrace, aud went to live at Mity-
lene. This happened aiter Lucretius' death. Memmius had some
power as an orator; but Cicero says oi him that his adherence to
Greek models and his dislike oi hard work interiered with his success
in this direction. He dabbled in verses oi questionable propriety, and
his liie was grossly immoral. Probably it was the dash and audacity

parts instead oi units. Here the meaning is ‘at every moment' or
‘point’ ‘oi time,’ i. e. ‘always' ‘even’ The phrase should be taken in
close connection with ornatum.

29. moenera: old spelling ior munera. By the use of occasional
archaisms Lucr. gives his style an antique aroma. -militiaiz the gen.
oi the first decl. in Lucr. has very often the old ending ai, which is
scanned as a spondee. A. 3⁶, a,· G. 27, Rem.1; Η. 49, 2 ς Roby,

ers shaping the worid’s destiny suggests the antithesis between Love
and Striie (outa or Φιλότης and Νεῖκος) that runs through the philoso-⁴
