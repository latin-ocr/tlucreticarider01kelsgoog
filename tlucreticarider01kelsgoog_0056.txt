l INTRODUCTION

Any system of philosophy is difficult to treat in verser it
involves necessarily the bringing in of many prosaic elements.
Whether a materialistic theory of the universe in this respect is
worse off than others itis not easy to decide. Α theistic or
pantheistic system has at least one advantage,-that by appeal-
ing directly to a divine intelligence and power it may save itself
much technical and tedious explanation in searching out the
long train of natural causes, while by dwelling upon a super-
natural element in life and law it tends to ennoble virtue and
give to human character a higher dignity. Epicureanism, in its
grasp on the infinity of space and time and number of worlds,
with the clashing of atoms in the void3 in its recognition of the

tremendous forces operating undirected in the processes of
⁴ nature3 and even in its bold denial of the divine and its fierce
arraignment of religion, was not lacking in elements of sub·
limity; while from its sympathy with nature it came close to
the springs of beauty. Yet the numberless dry details which
characterized all previous expositions of the' doctrine were such
as well-nigh to dely poetic treatment. ln his selection of
materials and his grasp ol the organic idea the artistic power of
the poet is well shown.

In his uniolding of the organic idea Lucretius takes up first, in
book 1., the fundamental doctrines of his system3 then in book
11., the special treatment of the atom. Book 111 is given to
a discussion of the soul, with special reference to its mortal-
ity3 book Ν, to the explanation of the phenomena of sensa-
tion. In book v. the poet sets forth the formation of the world,
with the beginnings of organic life; and traces the development
of man in civilization. Book v1. is devoted to the explanation
of the most striking natural phenomena. ln the logical order
of exposition the fifth and sixth books would naturally follow
the second. But so eager was the poet to dispel the {ears
inspired by the thought of death, that before completing his
theory of the universe he hastened to give his doctrine of the
soul and sense-perception, in order to disprove the soul’s immor-

tality. ln this arrangement there is consummate skill. lt isa
