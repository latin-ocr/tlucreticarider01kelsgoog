11. LUCRETIUS As A PHILOSOPHER.

(i.) Purtosonrrv nunno stru Rounws nr Locnurrus' Trur„

Tne genius ol the Romans was adapted to practical rather
than artistic construction. They wrought out the greatest re·
suits and made the most valuable contributions to humanity in
the domain of politics and law. For the arts, literature, and
philosophy, for all that has to do with the culture ol life as dis·
tinguished frorn its bare necessitieS‚ they were indebted to the
Greeks. The Greek masterpieces and verse-forms furnished
them models ior literary composition. Greek artists and sculp-
tors painted and carved for them. Greek teachers gave them
instruction in music and the liberal arts. Finally, the imitation
ol the Greeks in many of the ways ol common tite became the
fashion. ln the contact ol the two diverse forms of civilization‚
theone characterized by power ot' military and civil organization‚
the other hythe pre-eminent influence ol the individualmind
and the development of taste‚ that founded upon force prevailed
over the other only to be shaped by it. ‘Greece conquered,
took captive her rude conqueror, and brought the arts to rustic
Latium.’1

When the Romans first began to have leisure and a taste for
speculation‚ the Greek systems had already reached their fullest
expansion. The rapid extension oi Roman territory under the
old Republican form of government was then placing before
young men new political prizes to be won by personal power.
