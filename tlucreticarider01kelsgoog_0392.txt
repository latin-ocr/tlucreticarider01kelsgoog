328 LUCRETIUS [ΙΙΙ. 894-

894-6.“ Ci. the stanza oi Gray's ‘Elegy’ t -

‘¹ For thern no more the blazing barth shall burn.

Or busy housewile ply her evening care ς
, No children run to llsp their sires return,
Or cllmb tris knees, the envied kias to shareif

Edd. here compare also Georg. 2, 523-4 Interea dulces pendent ciream
ascula nati ,· Casta pudicitiam servat domus. 896. praeripere: the
infinitive, expressing purpose, is sometimes found after a verb oi mo
tion in Plautus, Terence, and Lucretius, and rarely in the Augustam
poets. 897. sacristiae: ‘prosperous doings.’ 898. misero
miseret misero is drawn irom its natural position near tibi, for the
sake of the assonance, oi which Lucr. is so iond. Cf. 99. to 666, 779.
899. dies: i.e.,martis. 999 illud: seen. to 1,8o 996. cinefac-
tum: ‘turned to ashes 'according to Nonius, asignification which Lach-
mann decides cannot be correct. Munro renders ‘turn to an ashen
hue ’; the meaning seems to be that the bereaved stood weeping near
the funeral pyre and gazed on the body as it was gradually consumed,
taking on the color oi ashes—busto: the funeral pyre; connected
with com-bu-ra. Bustum, says Festus, proprie dicitur lacus in qua
mortuus est combustus et sepultus. 908. dies: see n. to 1, ²33·
999 hoc: the weeping relative or iriend who has just spoken.-
amari: irom amarus.

gaes beyond recall ' ,· as estiie'rst ar any desire could follow tliem in death.
In sleep there is no thought os'selfariise5 so even aiore in death, in wht'ch

91²· discubuere: 19, in earmeaiei. 913. inum. ora: chaplets oi
leaves and flowers were worn at the drinking—bouts as an antidoto
against intoxicati0n; ara, ‘brows’ 914 homullis: with the
diminutive is associated the idea oi ‘insignificant,’‘ oi 99 account)
The thought is, ‘enjoyment is briei, hence take advantage ol it’; like
“ eat, drink, and be merry, lor tomorrow we die,” the motto oi most
Epicureans. This doctrine Lucretiae, true to the old Roman philos·
ophy oi lite, visits with stern censure. Herein he stands in marked
contrast with Horace, who would fill each day with pleasure; see Od.
r, 9 and 11 ς 3, 29 etc.; Martha ‘Lucrdce’ p. 1 59 et seq. ; also Munro's
n. 915. iam luerit: ‘presently it will have been' 916. cum
