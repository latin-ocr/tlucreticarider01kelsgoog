was “in letters what Scipio was in action, the most vital representa·
tive of his epocb. It was to him, not to Naevius or Plautus, that the
Romans loohed as the father oi their literature.” Os hiswritings only

looked to Ennius as his master in verse, and shows in many passages
traces oi his influence. Vergil likewise and others found in Ennius,

many bodies, among which in particular was that oi a peacoclt, had
come into his own. With this in mind Horace calls him alter Ho-
merus, though there is reference also to the Homeric llow oi his epic
