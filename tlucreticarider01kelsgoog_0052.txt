chasm between dead matter and the highest organic existences.
With his mind tull of the popular hylozoistic conceptions oi his
time, the step from matter to iiie seemed to him natural and
easy. Modern Materialism sees the difficulty, and obscures but
does not remove it, by taking refuge in a slow process of devel-
opment. indeed, it makes several unwarrantable assumptione
where Lucretius made one. The spontaneous origin oi life is
yet unproved, with the probabilities against it from the sailure
of repeated experiments to produce protoplasm. There are bar-
riers between types that have not been broken down, and that
are directly opposed to the present laws of reproduction. The
correlation oi physical and vital iorces is as unproved today
as in the time oi Lucretius. Assuming the doctrine oi descent
to be true, the adaptation and harmony that run all through it
proioundly emphasize the conception oi design in it. For that
cannot be taken out of matter which was not previously wrapt
up in it; and unless an intelligent, directing Power be assumed
behind matter this orderly uniolding is absolutely unaccountable.
The chauces are infinitely'against it. The general similarity

oi types throughout the organic world points not so much toa
likeness that might have been impressed upon all living things
by being leit as the wrack oi countless ages of existence beat-
ing against the merciless rock-barriers oi its environment, as to
a proiound “economy oi plan‚'’ in accordance with which an
infinite Wisdom shaped the sorms oi life, like the crystalla, so

that they stand to one another in a relation oi marvellous har·
mony and beauty.

While the Materialism oi our day isan outgrowth‚ in part,
oi the predominant interest now given to the natural sciences,
both irom the enthusiasm oi rapid advances in investigation
and irom their wide-reaching practical applications, and in part,
of the industrial and material trend of our civilization, the aim
it professes is not so much to aid the scientist as to iumish a
rule oi duty. The ioremost materialists have the same con·
tempt ior religion that Lucretius had, though they are not so
vehement in their expression3 and their philosophie purpose,
