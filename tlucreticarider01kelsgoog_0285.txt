sing. oi nouus in -ius and -r'um in Lucr. always ends ini. The gem
ending i-r' first appeared toward the close oi the Republic, and did not
become common till the earlier part ot the Empire. Favonius (trom
firveo, ‘quia flavet rebus nascentibus ¹), also called Zephyrus atter the
Greek, was the west wind, the blowing of which marked the opening
oi spring. Cf. Plin. N. H. 18, 34, 77, hic (vadus) ver inchoat aperit·
que terras tenui frigore saluber, hic vitr's putandi frugesque curandi,
arbores serendi, poma inserendi, oleas tractandi ius dabir afflatuque nutri·

as that oi Ennius and Naevius. It ie, however, so skilfully employed
by our poet that it never becomes cloying, and is oiten very effective.
Here the hard strokes of the p-sound through the ear aid the mind in
forming a vivid conception oi the bounding oi the herds over the
fields. Ci. 5993. See also Pelle,‘Introd. to Greek and Latin Ety-
mology,' 3d ed. ch. 6. 15. capta agrees with the subject to be
supplied for sequitur from quamque. The ordinary construction would

spurious line Illicebrisque tuis omnir natura animantum, which crept
into the text from an attempt to make capta etc. intelligible.
