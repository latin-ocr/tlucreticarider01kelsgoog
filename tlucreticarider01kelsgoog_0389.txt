ch. 17 c (α). Ci. Epicurus in Diog. Laert. ro, 27, ¹²5 ‘Theretore the
most dread-inspiring oi all evils, death, is nothing to us3 ior when we
exist death is not present to us, and when death is present, then we are
notin existence. It does not concern, then, either the living or the
dead3 tor to the living it hasne existence, and the dead do not them·
selves exist’ Ci. also the second oi the Κύριαι δόξαν (Diog. Laert. 139 B'
and Sext. Pyrrh. 3, 229): '0 θάνατος οὖδὲναρὸςὴμᾶς’ τὸ γὰρ διαλυθέν, ἀναι-

takes its subject irom the postquam-clause, to which also nostro de eor·
pore belongs. As a supposition contrary tu reality generally takes the
subjunctive, the indic. here is very torcible. 845. comptu: ‘the
uniting ’; iound only here. cf. n. to 1, 950.

847 et seq. Munro quotes a striking passage from St. Aug. De Cir.
Dei, 22, 28 mirabilius autem quiddam Marcus Varro ponit in libris, quos
eorescripsit de gente populi'Romani, errius putavi verba epra ponenda.
'Gerulleliaei quedam scripserunt' inquit, ‘esse in renascendis hame'reibus

has retinentia atter Avancius3 nostri is Lachmann's reading, aiter Pius
and Gitanius. Repetentia is elsewhere found only in Arnobius‚ a con-
