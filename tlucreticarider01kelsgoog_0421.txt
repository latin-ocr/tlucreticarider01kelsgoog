534 med. mundi reg: cf. 1, 1052 et seq. and nn. ΤΙιο universe
has no centre, but the world has. Lucr· nowhere gives a hint as to his
idea of the earth’s shape. From his rejection of the belief in the
antipodes, however, and from what is said here of a nature beneath
supporting it, we may suppose that he conceivedoi it as flat. Epicurus
(Diog. Laert. 10, 74) says that ‘we are not to suppose that the worlds
oi necessity have one and the same shape.’ According to Diog.
Laert. he taught that some are spherical, some ellipticai‚ and others
of other shapes. Regarding the shape of the earth, however, no defi·
nite statement oi his has come down to us ; he merely says that it
rests suspended on the air (τὴν γῆν τῷ ἀέρι ἐπικεῖσθαι). This is sug·
gestive ot the view of Anaximenes, that the earth is broad and flat,
and is supported by the air. Leucippus and Democritus supposed it
to be “an exceedingly flat cylinder, which supports itself on the air
by means oi its breadth.” 537. uniter: seen. to 3, 839. 538. vi-
vit: truly a strange word for a thoroughgoing materialist to apply to
the earth Ancient thought was permeated with hylozoistie and pan-
theistic ideas; cf. n. to 514 aetcrm. 544 per multo: shouldbe
permulto. 545. quid eto: ‘what function each thing has to per·
form! 560. potis: see n. to 1, 452· For the thought cf.3‚ 161
etseq.

564-5. Cf. the statement of Epicurus, Diog. Laert. 16, 91 ‘ In re·
gard to the size oi both the sun and the other heavenIy bodies, it is
indeed, as far as pertains to us, such as it appears to be.' This doc·
trine seems to have been peculiar to Epicurus and his followers.
Leucippus and Democritus held that the sun is much larger than the
earth, and that the shadows of mountains can be traced on the
moon's suriace. Cf. Cic. De Fin. 1, 6, 203 Acad, 2, 26, 8²3 Plut.
Plac. 2, 21, 4; Sen. N. Q. 1, 3, 10. 5⁶4 solis rota: ci. 432.
566. quibus . . . cumque: tmesis. 568. illa: spatia. 571. loca:
i.e.‚ corporum nostrorum. 572. filum: ‘size’ 575. notho: ‘not
genuine,'i.e., ‘not her own,' ‘ horrowed! Whether the moon shines
with her own or with horrowed light cannot be known, and makes no
difference3 the size is not greater than it appears to be. Cf. 705 etseq.
and nn. 57'8. quam: supply figura. 579. prius: with 581 quom.
