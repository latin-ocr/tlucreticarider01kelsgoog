its tullest development and exposition, and its widest
application. The Dc Rerum Natura reveals its deepest

significance only when studied in connection with the
thought of today.

It is perhaps worth while to remark that the Notes
were first written throughout without referring to any
- commentary. Other editions were then made use of, and
whatever was gleaned from them will be found duly ac-
knowledged. Little aid was derived from any except
those of Lambinus and Munro. From the latter much
hasbeen drawn; in the case of several obscure passages
Munro’s rendering even, from its aptness aud accuracy‚
has been adopted. Valuable hints have been derived
from Martha's ‘Le Podme de Lucrdce,' and especially
from Sellar's scholarly and appreciative discussion of
Lucretius in the ‘Roman Poets of the Republic' Other
writings that have been found of use are cited in the
Notes. Thanks are due to friends for suggestions and
criticisms, aud to several Faculties for the loan from
university libraries of old editions of the poem, as well

as other rare books bearing upon the subject.
