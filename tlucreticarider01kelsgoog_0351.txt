infinite number oi moving atoms, infinite space and infinite time, a
universe like the present could or would result, belongs properly to
the Calculus oi Probabilities. See nto 823-6; Janet, ‘Final Causea,
App, x., i.; Burr, ‘Doctrine oi Evolution,’ Second Series? sect. 63
Charpentier, ‘Memoire sur la logique du prohahle! The position oi
Lucr. is esseutially that oi modern materialistic evolution, whose
“ claim is that a cloud oi atoms, endowed with definite spberes ot
attraction and repulsion, is able to work out all the results which
seem to us to manifest intelligence and purpose.” See Bowne, ⁴ Re-
view ot Herbert Spencer,' p. 2343 ct. pp. 19-22· Spencer declares
that “this transformation oi an indefinite, incoherent homogeneity into
adefinite, coherent heterogeneity, which goes on everywhere until it
brings about a reverse transformation, is consequent upon certain
simple laws ot force.’' Still more outspoken is Haeckel, ‘Nat Hist.
ot Creation,’ ch. 1 ( i. zol: ‘⁴ Whilst, then, we emphatically oppose the
vital or teleological view oi animate nature, which presents animal and

vegetahle forms as the productioris of a kind Creator, acting tor a ·

definite purpose, or ot a creative, natural force acting ior a definite
purpose, we must, on the other hand, decidedly adopt that view oi
the universe which is called the mechanica! or causal. It no longer
¹ occurs to physicists, chemists, mineralogists, or astronomers to seek

Ἴ to find in the phenomena which continually appear before them in

their scientific domain the action oi a creator acting ior a definite pur·
pose. They, universally, and without hesitation, look upon the phe-
nomena which appear in their different departments of study as the
necessary and invariable effects of physical and, chemical forces
which are inherent in matter.'' Cf. Btichner, ‘Krait und Stoff’3

infinite time past? The assumption oi infinity of time is as essential
to modern as to ancient materialism. “ Who knows what might hap

the great cycles or cosmic years taught by many oi the ancient philoso-
phers, particularly the Pythagoreans, Heraclitus, and the Stoics. The
