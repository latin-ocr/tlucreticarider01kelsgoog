probabilitiesit may be shown that, with the requisite number¹ oi throws

of the letters, any verse oi the Iliad will be not only a possible, but
evena necessary result. For it is a possible combination, inasmucb
as it already exists ; in the shiiting oi letters, in infinite time, all pos·
sible combinations will appear. The universe, likewise, is a possible
combination, for it exists. Granted an infinite number oi atoms
moving in infinitespace through infinite time; all possible combina-
tions, oi which this universe is one, must result3 further, in the
numberless combinatione it might be an accident of this worldcom-
bination that, by a balancing of forces owing to a union oi atoms
moving in different directions, it might endure ior atime; itis
known, too, that this universe, at least the part with which wc are
familiar, is undergoing gradual change-is then in its present form
by no means permanent. But even granting to materialists that by
a chance swirl ot atoms during'infinite time the universe as it stands
could come into existence3 they are not a whit less dependent on a
Final Cause. Whence did the atoms get their shapes, so that it is
possible ior them to combine? Whence did they receive the impulse
oi motion‚which must be postulated in order to bring about any result
whateverl-ior dead matter cannot move itseli As the Stoic, Mani-
lius, put it (Astron, i. 490-1) :-

quis credat tantas operum sine nurnine moles
ex minimis, caecoque creatum loedere mundum?

The modern reasoner of materialistic tendencies, however, takes
refuge in Agnosticism. Thus, Tyndall says l‘Frag. oi Sci' p. 4²1l²
“If you ask him (the materialist) whence is this ‘Matter'of which
we have been discoursing, who or what divided it into molecules,
who or what impressed upon them this necessity oi running into or·
ganic forms-he has no answer.'’ But there must be some one to
cast the letters the requisite number oi times before the verse oi the
Iliad can appear; so there must be some power to set whirling
through immensity those atoms which, in infinite time, passing into
all possible combinations, might have produced this one. See nn.
