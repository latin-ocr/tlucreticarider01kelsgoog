caeli turbinis. 628. fervida signa: wrongly explained by Zel-
l'er, ‘Prae-Soc. Phil! ii. 250, n. 3 as “the signs of the Zodiae in which
the sun is in summer.” They are rather, as Muuro observes, those
signs oi the Zodiac which are higher, and hence are carried on in
more rapid revolution. 629-31. The nearer the moon's course is
to the earth the less able it is to keep up with the swiftermoving
signs above it. 635-6. The signs in their swifter revolution come up
to the moon and pass by it (praeterque feruntur). Now they com·
plete their circuit and overtake it again, and so ους the moon in
consequence appears to be travelling faster than they in an oppo-
site direction; it seems to be hastening to meet the signs, when in
reality they are going much laster in the same direction, and continu-
ally overtaking it. 637. a'e'r: the poet has in mind two air-
currents, as indicated by alter in 638: the one blows the sun from the
summer signs to those oi winter; the other blows it ‘from the winter
signs to those ol summer. Cl. n. to 511 οἱνα. 638. alternis:

stellar revolutions; seen. to r, 1029· But cf. Diod. Sic. 2, 46 λέγω,

show the influence ol the Aratea. 646. diversis ete: ‘with
winds blowing from opposite quarters the clouds go in opposite di-
