xxxvi INTRODUCTION

beginnings of a better life came with the discovery of fire.
Men learned the nature of this from the igniting of things by
lightning or from the flames produced by the rubbing togetherof
the branches of trees. They could now warm their shivering
- bodies, and the sun taught them how to cook their fond· Tben
came the use of clothing ol skins, the building of huts, and the
institution of marriage with its sostening influences.¹

Language originated not by invention but by nature. Certain
sounds came naturally to express certain feelings or designate
particular objects, just as the untaught gestures of infants and
the eries of animals convey a meaning that can be understood.²
Men more gifted than theirfellows found out better ways of doing
things, and taught the others. Kings arose, who began to build
cities and citadels. There was a division of lands and of cattle,
according to beauty of person, physical powers, and preeminence
of ability. But soon men discovered what wealth is; and it
brought in its traina throng of baneful ambitione, wrenching
well-deserved honors from the natural leaders. The kings were
overthrown, and society went back to utter anarchy. Finally,
weary of constant striie men agreed to keep the peace with one
another, holding the weak in mutual protection, and forcing
wrong-doers to respect fair laws.⁸ The origin of religion is to
be found partly in visions in which forms larger than life and
images of the dead seem to be present, partly in the wondering
awe with which men looked upon the phenomena of the heavens,
the suu, moon, stars, meteors‚ lightning, hail, show, and rain.
ignorant of the causes of things they attributed the mysterious
processes of nature to the gods, and made for themselves cruel
masters; hence all manner of degrading rites, the greatest
crimes, and evils innumerable. There is no piety io complying
with the observances required by religion.⁴

The metals were discovered in the burning of forests, for
thereby veins of ore were melted‚ and ran into hollow places
