Romans themselves sometimes identified Matuta with Leucothea, the
daughter oi Cadmus. 664. dispersos etc: edd. reser to Diod
Siculus, 17, 36, where this phcuomenon is described at length; cf.
also 'Id 3, 47. It was doubtless due to refraction. In some regions
the sun often appears of irregular shape. 669. certo eto: the poet
here, as often, appeals to the observed fact oi the uniformity oi na-
ture aud the regularity oi natural proeesses. Cf. 1, 174 et seq. and n.
to 1, 586. 671. arbusta: secuto 1, 187. Ι 677. fuerunt: see
n. to r, 406. 679. conseque: see nn. to 1, 215 and 560. Conse·
qr'r‘e quoque iam redeunt is Lachmann’s emend. ior consequare quoque
iarn rerum. 681. luces: lor dics, as often. 682. autz the
correlatives are below, 696 and 7010-idem: ‘the same’ sun as
opposed to the notion in 701-3oi a fresh sun every morning.-
684 orbem: ‘orbit’ 685 etseq. ln running courses ot un·
equal length above and below the earth, the sun adds justas much to
the one part as is taken from the other ; the longer that part oi his
course above the earth is, just so much the shorter that part below the
earth will be, and vice versa. The inequality will continue till the sun
reaches the equiuoxes (anni nodus), at which the day and the night are
equal in length. 689. cursu: ior cursu solia—flatus: geu. aiter
medio ‘midway between! 690, metas: usually explained as the
two tropics. Munro, with good reason, makes it refer to the points
where the sun rises and sets ;¹ ‘⁴ the heaven keeps his two goals at an
equal distance hom north and* south, i.e., speaking roughly the sun
rises and sets due east and west ;'’ and this is so ‘on account of the
position oi the whole starry circle.’ 695. notarunt: ‘mapped out)
701. sic: i.e., a'i're crassiore. 7⁰³· certa parte: “a particular
quarter, which varies every day throughout the year,'' Munro ex-
plains. Alter 704 a verse has fallen out, Munro thinks, something
like qui finiunt solis nova semper lumina gigni ,¹ otherwise 704 is well·
nigh meaningless where it stands3 Lachmann attaches it to 703, and
makes no change, but with extreme violence to the sense.

(6) rue moon may borrow its light from tlte arn, orshr'ne witti its oron
light, or be made aneto every day. 705-7 50.

707. speciem: ‘sight’3 so 7243 4, 236 and 24²· 706 donique:
old form oi donec, found also 723, 997; 2, 11163 donimm also is some·
times met with in theolder writers. See Neue,‘ Formenlelrre‚’ ii. 80 5;
