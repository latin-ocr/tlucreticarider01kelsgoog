vortex, the beginning oi a world. Thus the world in which we

are, originated At first there was a chaos oi clashing and en·
tangled atoms. Then gradually came a differentiation into parts,
like gathering with like. The heuviest particles settled ina mass.
Out oi this the lightest aud smoothest were pressed‚ forced to
the outermost bounds, and there united in a close-worm, envel- ⁴
oping sphere‚ the aether. Beneath this the air spread out.
Midway between the aether and the earth the atoms beavier
than the one, yet lighter than the other, gathered‚ forming the
sun and moon; some passing higher still made the stars. The
earth as it settled together grew rough in ridges and plains,
mountains and valleys, as the parts of its suriace being of
unequal density could not give way the same. Into the hollow
places the smoother atoms were pressed, making the sea.¹ The
earth is in the mid-region oi the world. Underneath it lies a
nature with which it is closely united, akin to the air above.
Its weight diminishes below, so that it rests in calm poise¹
Around it with unequal speed the heavenly bodies revolve in
lateral orbits.⁸ The sun and the moon are oi the same size that
they seem tous to be.⁴ Our world, like all things else, is
doomed to destruction.⁵
