agnis potesse etc Like the English do th is id facere often takes the
place ol a clause. The reasoning in θός-9 seems to be: In no other

of a primitive fireessence is exploded, and they must fall back to· the
position that all things existent are produced from nothing.

670-1. These lines are repeated 1, 79²·33 2, 753-43 3, 519-520, to
emphasize the doctrine that each thing has a limited power, a circum·
scribed sphere of existence, outside ol which change of lorm and
destruction will meet it. See n. to 76 672. proindet in Lucr.
usually scanned as a dissyllable; ‘hence' ‘therefore.'-aliquit : see
n. to 469 aliut. -ollis: archaic for illis; common in Lucr. The root

lish the pronouns ol the first and second persons are thus used otten
by the earlier, sometimes even -by the later writers. Cf. Shakspere,
‘King Henry Fourth,’ Part 1, 4, 3, “ Cut me off the heads Ol all the
favorites3 '’ Carlyle, ‘Frederiek the Great,' Bk. 2, ch. 11 “A terrible
dragon ol a woman. . . . claps you an iron cap on her head, and takes
the field where need is.'' For lull discussion see Maetzner, ‘English
Grammar,’ Am. edit. ii. arr.

676-7. Cf. the words ol Epicurus in Diog. Laert. to, 24, 54: ‘In
· the dissolution ol combined bodies ot necessity there remeius some·
thing solid and indestructible‚ which will not undergo change into the
non-existent nor lrom it. changes, however, it will undergo, in most
cases by mutation ol parts, but in some by the coming and going ol
atoms 1.. ἀλλὰ κατὰ μεταθὲσεις ἐν πολλῶν ἐπὶ τινᾶν δέ, κατὰ
προσόδους eal ἂφόδονς1. 678. conv. corp. sese: a kind ot

positura, position, relative to other atoms3 figurae, ‘shapes' fully
discussed a, 333-580. 687. naturam: ie. of things, not ot atoms,

to the Epicurean theory of sense-perception, that from the surlaces of
things there are continually thrown off thin films ol matter that strike
upon our senses, and thus by impact excite sensation. For fuller dis·
