LUCRETIUS As A PHILOSOPHER xlvii

like his, is largely ethical.1 Their psychology agrees with his, at
least negatively, in denying the intuitions. Their theory of the
supreme good is at bottom the same, though arrived at in a
somewhat different way. The view oi man's development in ’
civilization and the origin oi institutions set forth by Lucretius
anticipated important modern theories‚ which are by no means
confined to the doctrines of materialists, but which, in part
at least, have been confirmed hythe late investigations oi
archaeologists‚ and are generally accepted.⁹

All that is most valuable and suggestive in Lucretius’ doctrine
of the atom has its counterpart in modern science; and the
atomic Materialism of the day, stripped oi what belongs not
alone to it but to science in general, to theistic as well as to
atheistic and agnostic theories oi the universe, is precisely
Lucretius’ doctrine oi the nature of things, less the blunders in

lact and method unavoidable in the state oi knowledge of his
time. Great as is the scientific value of the doctrine oi evolu-
ἱ tion as a working hypothesis in investigation, as a convenient
system of classification ior related laets oi the organic world,

when applied to the explanation oi the universe with no God
it breaks down utterly. The materialistlc evolution of our time,
then, is simply the Materialism ot Lucretius, wrought over in
accordance with the scientific methods and adapted to the scien·
tific knowledge of our day. Subjected to the scrutiny oi careful
criticism, it is found to be nota whit nearer to a settlement of
the fundamental questions oi existence than the system oi the
Roman poet.
