747 et seq. According to the view oi Lucr, there is no qualitative or
essential difference between the mind and soul oi animals and the
mind and soul of man. This, in fact, is a common tenet oi believers
in metempsychosis, materialists oi all ages, and oi evolutionlsts with
materialistic tendencies. It was, perhaps, most fully unfolded by the
French rationalists oi the latter part oi the last century; but Haeckel
and those who share his iorm oi the Doctrine oi Descent insist upon
it quite as strenuously as they. “11, as is usually done, we divide the
different emotions oi the soul into three principa] groups,— sensa-
tion, will, and thought—we shall find in regard to every one oi them
that the most highly developed birds and mammals are on a level
wilh the lowest human beings, or even decidedly surpass them.” l
Haeckel, ‘ Nat. Hist. oi ,Creationss ii. 3643 cf. the rest oi the chapter.
The proof, however, is as conspicuously lacking as in the time oi
Lucr. Consult Bowen, ‘Gleanings from a Literary Life: pp. 328—3503
