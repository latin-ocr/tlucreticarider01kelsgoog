346 LUCRETlUS [V. 275-

and the ancients ln general, as regards the nature ol chemical changes
Still, 275-7 taken loosely embody an important fact, that innumerable
invisible bodies are present in the atmosphere, constantly passing off
irom things or coming into relation with them ; the error, oi course,
lies in supposing tlut these can become air. ²7ss contra: see n.
to 1,66; here, oi course, in a logical sense. 280. reccidere: see
n. to 1, 228. ²⁸4 prim quicq. etc: ‘every preceding emission of
brightness is quite lost to it, wherever it falls! 183 hinc: refers
to what follows, as indicated by the punctuation. 287. inter
qu. rumpere: tmesis 28& inferior: ie, beneath the cloud
289. qua: goes with mmqaee. 295. lychini: Munro, ior chlini,·
Lachmann writes lychni, the common form ot the word; but Munro

thinks Lucr. knew only the trisyllabic form, “whether he wrote lychini
or luchini or lichini5 or even one oi the still older forms lucini or

licini.” The pendentes lychini were lamps suspended by chains from
the ceiling. With this line cf. Verg. Aen. 1,726 dependent lychni laque-
aribus aureis5 see Macrobius, Sat. 6, r, 18. 296. taedae: slips of
pine, used sor light in processione, and ior going into dark places3
sometimes also ior torture; cf. 3, 1017. They correspond to the
‘pine knots' so much used in the South and in irentier settlements.
299-301. The place oi the perishing light is so quickly and continu·
ously supplied by new light that no change is noticed.

3. Racks and the most enduring structuras finalhe yield to time, and
decay. 306-317.

see n. to 1, 586. 312. sene: Munro, ior cumque. Lachmann
reads the line quaesere proporro vetitumque senescere eredas, in which
there seems to be unnecessary change ; sene, ie. se-ne, not from senex.
Trans. ‘Ask ior themselves as well whether you 'd believe that they
decay with yearsi' 313. silices: see n. to 1, 571· 31⁶. quae:
= si ea. 318. hoc: i.e.,caelum. Cf. n. to 1, 250 pater aether.
