222 LUCRETIUS [1. 21-

the syncopated form ar. quae: the necessary English hans.
‘thou' lails to bring out the relation with the preceding thought
which the relative in the more accurate and subtle Latin idiom
expresses.

rerum naturam: Lueretius uses natura in many different senses·
Here and in 2 5 by natura rerum is meant what we often understand
by ‘nature,’-the sum and system oi things existent; as Humboldt
defines it (‘Cosmos,' tr. by Otte', Introd.): “Nature considered ra-
trhnally, that is to say, submitted to the process oi thought, is a
unity in diversity oi phenomena; a harmony, blending together oi
all created things, however dissimilar in form and attributes; one
great whole (rb πᾶν) animated with the breath oi lite.’' Oiten our
poet personifies nature, regards her as a mysterious living presence,
that “makes herself felt as a peculiar and independent power.” Cf.
’ especially 2, 1090-92: ‘It you keep in mind these things well
thought out, nature untrammelled at once and iree from haughty
masters is seen ot her own accord by herself without the power of
the gods to do all things' The idea oi a will behind all movement
is so firmly impressed upon the minds oi men that, strive as they may
to believe in pure chance or necessity, they generally end by personi-
iying something. Fate in antiquity was only a personification of
natural law. It is a significant iact that materialists oi our own time
often spell matter and evolution with capital letters. Evolution, a
process, takes the place oi a deity, and matter is thought to contain
the “promise and potency ot all terrestrial liie” (Tyndall). “It
seems almost a matter oi taste whether we worship the masculine God,
the feminine Nature, or the neuter All.” Lange, ‘Hish of Material-
ism,’ tr. iii. 340. On Lucretius' conception oi Nature as a person·
ality, see Ritter, ‘Hist oi Ancient Philosophy,’ Bohn's cd. iv. 87-88.
Lucr. also uses the word natura to express ‘natural constitution' oi
a thing, ‘substance' and the like.

22-3. quicquam. . . exoritur neque fit. .. quicquam ob
serve the chiasmus. A. 344, f; G. 684; H. 562. A like arrange·
ment ot words often adds a charm to English style, as in Milton's
“dulcet symphonies and voices sweet” aa. luminis oras: a
favorite expression of Lucr.‚ by which he suggests the dim bordet-
land between that which is and that which is not, the existent and the
non-existent. See Munro's note. 25. de rerum natura: whence
Lucr. drew the title oi his work can only be conjectured Περὶ φύ-
