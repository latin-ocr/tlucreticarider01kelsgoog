sires, by a life of rational indulgence„ The Sceptic, on the con· ’
trary‚ believing that the truth about things cannot be known,
and that all the troubles of humanity come srom adherence to
uniounded opinions, endeavored to attain happiness in peace of

mind gained by withholding judgment regarding all matters, by
