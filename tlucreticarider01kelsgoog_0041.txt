LUCRETIUS As A PHILOSOPHER xxxv

The power of voluutary movement and free-will are due to that
swerving of atoms in the void. llad this not occurred he would
have been bound and controlled by inexorable necessity.¹ But
since there is freedom of will, man has in his own hands the
shaping of his character and the directiug of his life.² The
supreme good is happiness; which may be found indeed in
pleasures of the body under proper restraint, but principally in
perfect peace of mind, like that of the gods. Life is short and
ought to be enjoyed.⁸ The greatest ills are those corroding
fears oi the supernatural and the hereafter which religion has
inspired‚ and which vex men and weigh them down under a bur-
den of dread. These the philosopher will entirely overcome.⁴
Death ends all. For the wise it has no terrors3 indeed, when
the pains of life prevail over its pleasures one may rightly take
refuge in itt He will make the most of existence who ministers
frugally to the body's simple needS‚ and free from the mad am-
bitions and feverish passions of the messes, never disturbed by
anything‚ holds to the last the ‘high and serene places well for-
tified by the learning of the wise,'⁸ and meets his end with
untroubled breast.

The history of the race reveals a continual progression from
a lower to a higher stage. The primitive men were utterly
savage. They were of larger and sturdier frame than those of
to-day, and lived like brutes. Their food was acoms and bernes,
their drink the running water. Dwellings they had not ; they
took refuge from the elements in woods and caves. Sometimes

, they followed wild beasts with clubs‚ sometimes were pursued

in turn, and often in the night were driven in terror from their
leaf-strewn beds. Still, the death-rate was not greater than
now; for there were no vars, none fell victims to the dangers of
the sea, and meu were innocent of the use of poisons.⁷ The
