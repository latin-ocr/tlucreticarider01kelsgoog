The two following arguments ore closely related,
and also assume the doctrine of pre-existence:-

(18) If the sorel were introduced into man at birth, it would not per·
uode the entire body, but be gothered together in one particular spot, as in a
hole by itsels,· whereas on the contrary the whole body, even to the teetb
and bones, is sensitive. 679—697.

(19) Again, on the same supposition, in being thus diffused through the
body, the soul must perish ,· just as sood spreading throughout tlte frome
perislies, and goes to form a new reature. 698-712.

679. peri. corps: i.e., when the body is fully formed, and ready to
be born. 686. en. viv. potes: see nto 1, 7²· 682. con-
veniebat, etc.: conv. uiuere ita nt uideatur cresse (ε crevisse) etc.
685. “ Clearly a sarcastie gloss ; ’' rejected by Lambinus etc, but re·
tained by Lachmann, who instead of affluat reads arceat. 689. mor-
bus: i.e.‚ dolor dentium. 690. oppressus: i.e., dentibus ,·
‘crunched.’-irugibus: by metonymy lor pane. 691-2. That is,
souis had a beginning, and must have an end, of life. 766. qui·
que: old abl, found only here and in the same phrase 5, 3433
strengthens magis. The qul is probably the same as in utqui. See
Munro’s n. to 1, 755. 701. The 'argument ol the line is a good
illustrationes the non seqnitur. 7⁰⁵· quamvls: with indic.; see
n. to 403. -reeens : belongs with corpus. 710. illa: i.e., animo.

(20) Are particles of the saul lcy‘t behind in the deod body or noll
ss so, the soul cannot be immortol, sirice it hasbeen united· is not,
whence corne the sorels of the living things that appear in carcassesl
These cannot comesione without ,· sor, do we suppose thot while bodiless
they hunted aronnal clud got bodies? A discmbodied soul would haue no
ruotwcsor taking upon itsels the ills ariel pains os existence in a body, ond
could not make for e'tself a body, euen {fit should so desire, Or do we
imagine that they entered bodies sully formed? In that case, they
would not be so closely connectcl with these as to haue common feeling.
