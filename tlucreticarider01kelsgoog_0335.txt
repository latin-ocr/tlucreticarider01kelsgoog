ae‘r generally has the Greek form, but afrem is found a few times;
so the acc. oi aether is aethera, rarely aetherem. Anaximenes and
Diogenes ol Apollonia were the two principal philosophers who
taught that air is the single primal clement. For full discussion, with

Thales and Hippo. See Zeller ut sup„ or Ritter, ⁴ Hist. oi Ano. Phil’
vol. i. 709. terram: Aristotle (Met. 1, 8-a chapter in which the
doctrine oi a single material cause is ably criticised) states that none
