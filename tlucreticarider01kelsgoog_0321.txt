reading, adopted also by Lachmann. The meaning is the same in
either case. permittatis is tound only here3 but permitier ‘ destruc·
tion‚'‘rnin,' ‘decay’ is several times met with. 453. potis: here ,
not declined; pote, however, is sometimes met with. Either form
is rare in classical prose, where potest is used instead-seque
greg: tmesis; segregari would not suit the metre. 453. liquor: ·
the i is here lengthened 454. Lachmann has shown that this
verse is an interpolation. The datives are inconsistent with the pre·
