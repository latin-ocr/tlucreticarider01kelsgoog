Lucnsrrus [1. 644-

“ Words ol' learned length aud thuoderlng mund
Amazed the garing mistice rauged arouud·'’

Like Lucr, the author ol the ‘Systeme de la N ature' complains that
'¹ men ever prefer the marvellous to the simple, what they do not un·
derstand to what they can understand.” The whole passage is quoted
by Lange, ‘ Hist. ot Μαι) ii. 119. Munro thinks that the poet here is
aiming directly at the Stoics under the term stalaiia‘, retorting ⁴‘ upon
them their own term ol reproach.”

elements were made out ot fire by condensation, the lighter by rare·
fection, the argument is uuanswerable. But it applies to the Stolos,
not to Heraclitus3 lor he taught that the process ol change is trans-
mutation ol substance, something entirely different. See n. to 638
above. 651. disque sup: tmesis. 653. nedum: ‘much the
less ’ς malum is properly a final conj, ‘while uot' According to Roby
(ᾖ ι658) the usage here “arises from the prevention of the occur·
