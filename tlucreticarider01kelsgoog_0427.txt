or in any of the ways in which we speak of similar phenomena hap-
pening before our eyes; with this condition, however, that one do not
devote himself to any one opinion, rejecting the others inconsider-
ately, and, being ignorant of what it is possible, what impossible, to
explain, on this account become desirons of explaining things that
cannot be known. Perhaps the moon shines by her own light,
perhapsshe gets it from the sun, for among us one sees many things
having light of their own, and many shining by reflection. . . . The
appearance of a face in the moon may be due to a transposition of
parts, or to the interposition of some body, or to any other causes of
such character that they are able to account for appearances of this
kind! 733. privos: see n. to 3, 7²3· 734. parte: ‘room‚’ a

feature of the south Italian spring, and the winds were represented as
winged (pennatus). N. P. Howard, followed by Munro, quotes 4, 1057
namque voluptatem praesagit muta caprile, and thinks the reference is
to Cupid,-a wellchosen interpretation 3 Flora follows ‘⁴ on the steps
of Zephyr, in advance of Spring, Venus, and Cupid, and strews their
path with flowers.'’ 739. viai cuncta: see n. to 1, 86. 741.

June, July, and August in Central and Southem Italy winds blow from
the north and northeast with great regularity; they were hence called
etesiae (ἐτησίαι) because of their annual recurrence. Cf. Cic. N. D, 2,
