LUCRETIUS As A PHILOSOPHER xxvii

shape as the bodies from which they come, of movement incon·
ceivably swift.1 From the contact of these with the eyes vision
results. A square tower in the distance appears round, because
the idols in passing through the air are blunted‚ and have the
sharp corners worn down. From polished surfaces the idols
rebound; hence the reflection of mirrors. But they pass
through certain substances, as glass‚ so that the sight is not
hindered. To men with the jaundice things look greenish be-
cause of the greenish particles thrown off from the eyes, which
meet the coming idols and tinge them with that hue. The eyes
cannot bear to look at the sun because of the impinging force of
its idols and the seeds of lire in them.² The sense of hearing
distinguishes different sounds accordingto the different kinds of
atoms in them; for that sound is of material nature is made
clear by the hoarseness following much use of the voice, which
results from the friction of sound-atoms as they pass out of
the throat The penetrating power of sounds shows how
minute the sound-atoms must be.⁸ The senses of smell and
taste experience pleasure from the contact of smooth atoms, dis·
comfort from the presence of those rough or jagged.⁴

The finest idols even penetrate directly to the mind, which
is fitted thus to receive impressions from its physical nature.
Sometimes there is a mingling and confusion of idols in the air,
and mongrel forms seem to be perceived to which there is no
bodily reality corresponding; from such originated the concep·
tions of Centaurs‚ Scyllas, and the ΙίΙςε.6 As idols innumerable‚
of things past as well as present, are ever thronging before the
mind, it admits ln waking hours only those that it wishes to
’ receive3 hence the power of memory·.⁶ In slumber too the
idols come, and then men have dream, sometimes even horrid
visions of monsters and human figures larger than lise, and the
forms of the dead.l In the relation of the senses to the things
perceived and the phenomena of sensation no evidence of design
