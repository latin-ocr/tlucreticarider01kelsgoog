but it is not found in Cic. nor the Augustan writers except in quota-

especially by Cic-esse: = existere-Acherusia etc: the poet

—templat in the earlier writers, particularly Ennius, and after him
Lucr, whom in this usage Manilius imitatos, templum often has the
derivative meaning of a ‘space marked off' (root tem, cf. τέμ-νω).
Varro (L. L. 7, 6) remarks that it may be applied to places in the
heavens oron the earth or undet the earth. This signification of tcm-
pla was especially common in the language of augury, referring either
to the divisione of the sky or to places chosen for observation; for the
latter use cf. Liv. 1, 6. Trans. by ‘places’ ‘regions' ‘ quarters‚' accord·

what these ‘images' or ‘idols' were supposed to be it is difficult to
say. They seem to have been conceived of as intangible, immaterial
forms, just like the body in appearance, which went to Hades while
the soul departed elsewhere. According to the implied meaning of
the present passage the simulacra were in the lower world, while the
soul passed on through living bodies. For Ennius supposed Homer’s
soul was in himself, but speaks of the ‘image' (speciem) as appearing
to him. A like separation of soul and image is perhaps implied in
Verg. Aen. 4, 385, where in substance Dido says that when death shall
have severed soul and body, as a shade (umbra) she will be present in
all places, while report of Aeneas’ sufferings will come to her to the
lowest parts of Hades (ad imos manes); but see Conington’s nn.
