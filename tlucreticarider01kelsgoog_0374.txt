378-80 The atoms of soul must have between them spaces at
least aa great as the sire of the smallest bodies (corpora), which
can first (primo) excite sensation by coming in contact with the body
(in corpore). “But does not the body feel '' <Mum well explains)
“as well as the soull Yes3 he has elaborately proved already that
theone feels as well as the other, and that neither of the two cari
possibly feel without the other ; but he has also shown that the indm
molus must proceed from theonino, and not merely from the anima
but that part of it which is the animus, and not merely from the oni-
mus, but from that fourth nameless substance in it; the anima and
animus then form one connected whole in the body; if, therefore, any
atoms of the anima are moved they wu'll at once communicate with
the animus, and sense will commence and be imparted to the whole
anima, and from the anima to the body which will then feel. But
many atoms of the body, he argues, may be touched without any part
of the soul being moved, and, therefore, without there being any com-
mencement of sensation.” Cf. 391-5 below. 3⁸¹- adhaesum
