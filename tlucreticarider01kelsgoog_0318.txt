pMatter and void alone make up the universe.
418-482.

Ihm is matter, there is vetii (418-429). Bentics matter and vohi
there is no third nature (430-448). Whateoer exista is athera property
or an accedent ‹asmadcr and void (449-482).

418. ‘But now to proceed to weave throughout in verse the design
begun' ⁴1⁹· ut est: ‘asit is,'‘asit stands! Munro in his 3rd
edit. takes per se with ut est and trans ‘all nature, then, as it exists
by itselt,' which does not seem to make as good sense as the other
constr.; but see hism aas constititin: ‘ismade up of) With
this meaning consistere is followed by the simple abl. or by the abl. with
aa or in. Lucr. has the three constructions, but in only with rebus
