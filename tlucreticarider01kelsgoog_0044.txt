xxxviii INTRODUCTION

acquiesce iu the absolute authority oi the Greek philosophy,
though their minds were not inventive enough to establish a
rival by its side.’'¹ Lucretius ought not to be considered a ser·
vile imitator oi Epicurus. The doctrines which he accepted he
ardently believed in; and he iully assimilated them in both
their general range and minor details. When, therefore, ior the
sake oi his countrymen he began to expound them, they came
forth glowing from the depths of his heart and soul, and bore
not simply an individual but a distinctively Roman stamp. No
work oi the entire literature shows more clearly the bent oi the
national character. The earnestness ol purpose, the freedom
from quibbling or sophistry and the straightiorward grappling
with leading questions, the emphasizing oi the simplet modes
of lite and the homelier virtues, the stern and solemn, even
gloomy view of existence—all point to traits not merely of the
man but also of the nation.

The poem also indicates clearly the tendencies oi the age.
It is a protest against the degrading influences oi impure super·

stitions; against the sham and increasingdegeneracy of society3
against the reckless, mad ambitions and ceaseless ferment ot
political life. In a period grossly material in tastes and enjoy-
ments‚ when great iortunes were being rapidly made and were

ever bringing new luxuries in their train, it bids men taire refuge
and find true happiness in higher things, in pleasures of the
soul rather than the body. The mission oi Lucretius wasto set
forth the atomic Materialism as it appeared acceptable to the
Roman mind and adapted to meet the needs oi the Roman
character iota philosophy of life and rule of duty. Just so it-
was the mission of Seneca to expound Pantheism to his country-
men; and iu the almost religious fervor of his utterances about
virtue aud right living there is manifested the same spirit that
stirred our poet.

The influence of Lucretius' poem as a philosophie worlr can·
not be easily traced or readily estimated. The Latin writers ot
