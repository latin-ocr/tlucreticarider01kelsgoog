ameans of securing peace of mind. Upon this ethical purpose of
all science the Epicureans laid great stress. See Zeller, ‘Stoica Epi·

1. 11. Α word standing in the same relation to two others, however, is
often placed between them, - a usage by the old grammarians called
coniunctio. See Cornificius ad Herennium 4, 38 coniunctio est cum
interpositam verbi et napea-iores oratam partes comprehenduntur tt
inferiores, hoc modo: Formae dignitas aut morbo deflorescrtaut vamme.
This arrangement of words is especially common in Cicero. Cf. Cic.
De Am. 2, 8 cum summi viri tuna amicissimi and Reid's note.

as “the outward form and aspect ”aud “the inner law and principle
after which nature develops herself.” See n. to 586. 149. ‘The

'l'hat nothing can be produced from nothing was a doctrine common to
all the ancient physicists as well as to modern materialists. Who fust
definitely formulated it is not known; before the time of Aristotle it
seems to have become current as a physical axiom. This line of Lucr.
has been interpreted to mean that nothing can happen without ade·
quate cause (see Tait and Stewart, ‘The Unseen Universe,’ p. 132),-
a teaching that helda prominent place in the Stoic philosophy; but
a comparison with the statement of Epicurus, whom Lucr. so closely
followed, shows clearly that the reference is to the coming of the
existent out of the non-existent. Cf. Haeckel, ‘Nat Hist. of Crea-
tion,' ch. 1: “Never yet has an instance been observed of even the
smallest particle of matter having vanished, or even of an atom being
added to the already existing mass.'' Praetically, indeed, in the hands
of the experimenter matter is indestructible, and is hence inferred to
be without beginning; but the modern materialists are as a rule less
dogmatic regarding its eternal existence than the ancient. See
Haeckel, ut sup. ; Herbert Spencer, ‘ First Principles‚' Part 2, ch. 4.
The denial that by any agency matter can come into existence from
nothing involves necessarily its eternal pre-existence3 and this vio·
