oi combination they assumed manisold shapes of atonis, by
- means ol which these could become entangled and united in
all kinds ot things. The Epicureans rejected the law ol neces-
sity and all final cause, supposed¹ that atoms move downward in
empty space at the same rate, and assigned the occasion of i
atoms combining to the sels-movement ol some srom their course. ‘
ln this, without knowing 11, they were really attributing psychic
properties to the atom‚ and showed the influente of the old
hyiozoistic conception ol matter. Although they utilized this
voluntary power ol the atom only in explaining the lreedom of
the will, believing that everything in nature goes on rigidly in
obedience to law, the principle thus introduced was not lost
sight of, but was carried to its lullest application in the gradual
spiritualization ol the atom. It was enlarged upon by Bruno,
in the doctrine that “the elementary parts of all that exists are
the minima or monads‚ which are to be considered as points,
not absolutely unextended, but spherical ;„ they are at once
psychical and material.’' It permeates the system of Gas-
sendi, who, though he claimed simply to revive Epicureanism‚
“ascribed to the atoms lorce and even sensation.’'1 lt iound a
complete and final realization ln the monadologyol Leibnitz. For
in opposition to Spinoza’s doctrine oi one universal substance
with the attributes of thought and extension, leibnitz assumed
a plurality of elementary forms, which he made out to be in·
divisible points or particles‚ ‘⁴ punctual unities‚'’ qualitatively
different, each having a soul oi its own and bearing to the sum
of all a fixed relation ln a system ol universal harmony. As he
emphasized the spiritual side of these psychic atoms or monads‚
his tendency was idealistic3 and his doctrine marks a transition
from Materialisrp to ldealism. Brun0, Gassendi, and Leibnitz
accepted the Christian conception ol God, but seem to have
found it a difficult matter to reconcile this with their philosophy.
Bacon, as it has already been remarlred‚ adopted Democritus’

conception ot tbe atom‚ which was accepted also by Newton.
