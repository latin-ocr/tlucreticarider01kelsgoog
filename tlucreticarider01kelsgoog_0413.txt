7. ne world’s members, totly warring, are noro held in cbeck by dal·
ame offorces; but sometime deut mayconquer moisture, ormoisture beat.
Once, it is said, fire prcuailed, and oncewutem the like may huppen again
with destmction maaser-reaching. 380-415.

381. membra: four members are mentioned 235-63 but the poet
here speaks only oi the striie between fire and water. ln the last ·
paragraph the external causes oi destruction were discussed; he now
takes up the causes that may lurk within the world itself. —pio ne-
quaquam: because oi their relationship. 382. ollis: see n. to
1, 672. 383. vel curn etc: another vel would be expected, as
Munro observes, to complete the constr, but at 386 the poet gives a
different tum to the thought, and changes the form oi the sentence.
Instances of a like change oi constr. are not uncommon. With this
strife between fire and water Lambinus compares the famous θεῶν
μάχη, or contest between Apollo and Neptune, in Homer. Anaximan-
der held that the sea would sometime dry up ; this must lead to the
burning up of the earth, as the elements oi heat and fire would then
preponderate. Heraclitus taught that the present order oi things
would come to an end in a great conflagration; see n. to 1, 638. Cer-
tain of the Stoics believed that the world is sometimes destroyed by
fire and sometimes by floods, a new world always coming into exist-
ence aiter a fixed period. To the last point Boethius made the apt
objection that if the world burned up, the fire after a time must needs
go out for lack oi luel, and there would be nothing leit to make a new

world out oi. Xenophanes, too, seems to have taught the periodical Δ

visitation of the earth by tloods. 387. diluviare: not found else- ·
where. The thought oi 386-7 is explained by 269-272. 388·9. cf.
266-7. 394. cum: concessive. 394 is explained below 396-4053
395, 411-2. 396. superat: = superavit ,· see n. on r, 70 inritat.
397. Phaethonta: the poet interprets the myth oi Phaeton after the
manner oi the Stoics,supposing it to have a basis oi fact in some vast
and destructive conflagration. For a similar explanation of the story
see Keightley's ‘ Mythology.’ Lambinus compares Plato’s interpreta-
tion Tim. 22 c: ‘Now this has the form oi a myth, but really signi·
fies a declination oi the bodies moving around the earth and in the
heavens‚ and a great conflagration of things upon the earth recurring
at long intervals of time; when this happens, those who live upon the
mountains and in dry and lofty places are more liable to destruction
