The Atomic theory os the constitution oi matter has a history
lull ol interest and importance. lt lormed the groundwork oi
a Hindu system of philosophy. Introduced into Greek thought
by Leucippus and developed by Democritus, it was made by the
Epicureans the physical basis ol an ethics ol pleasure. Bacon
brought it into modern science, and Boyle applied it to Chem-
istry ; ⁹ while Gassendi attracted attention to its relation to the
problem ol the universe. Today the atomic theory of matter
is the dominant one among both scientific investigators and
philosophers. accepted often as unquestionable truth alike by
chemists and physicists, atheists and divines. It still remeius,
as in the time ol' Democritus, an unverified hypothesis. But
while it is no longer wedded to any one theory of the universe,
it is osten without good reason distinctively associated with the
doctrines ol materialistic evolution. In tracing the history ol
atomism, the two most important things to be considered are,
the nature oi the atom‚ and the means by which the relations
oi atoms with one another are thought to be adjusted.

The early Greek atomists conceived oi the atoms as periectly
