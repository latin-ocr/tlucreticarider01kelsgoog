frangere means ‘to break up ' a thing, usually a whole, by destroying
its structure; disturbare, ‘to demolish ² by rending the parts violently
asundert dissoluere. ‘to destroy utterly' by reduciug a thing to its
primal elements. leaving not the least vestige or trace oi its torm or
properties. 560. relicuo: scanned relicti& all the forms of this

predicative; corrstant=sunt. 56& cum: ‘while' ⁴ although,' mildly
concessive. In Plautus and Terence generally, sometimes even in
classical prose, cum concessive and cum eausal are found with the
