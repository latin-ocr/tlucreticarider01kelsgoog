the present universe. Opinions as to the value oi Empedocles’ sys-
tem were in antiquity very diverse; and so they remain today. From
him Lucr. received many suggestions, even taking his poem Περὶ
Φύσεως as a model (see n. to 25). To the likeness of his views to
those oi the Atomists and Epicureans the tulsone praise here is due.
But Plato, Aristotle, and especially the NeoPlatonist's, held Emp. in
much less esteem. From the evidence collected by Zeller (⁸ Ptae-Soc.
Phil! vol. ii.) the significance of his speculations seems to lie in three
things: (ι) He was the first to introduce into philosophy the concep
tion oi a moving cause independent oi matter,- in this loreshadowiug
Anaxagoras, who assumed an intelligent cause, Νοῦς, Mind. (2) He
brought into natural seience the conception oi primitive elements l as
opposed to a single form oi matter). He lixed the number at {uuna
number which, aiter his time, was generally accepted in antiquity, and
lingered till modern chemistry by experiment laid the foundation lor
a correct theory. Thus he became, along with Leucippus, “the founder
oi the mechanical explanation of the universe.” (3) In explaining
the development oi animal lite he taught a crude form oi evolution.

Ionian Gull (Ἰόνιος κόλπος) as synonymous with Adriatic. The later
geographers considered the Ionian Sea as extending along the south
coast oi Italy, including the entrance oi the Adriatic, and reaching on
the one hand as iar as Greece, ou the other to Sicily. The Latin writ-
ers, generally, use the term in this latter sense. See Smith, ‘Dice ot
