Cic. N. D. 1, 8, 2ο quae est enim coagmentatw non dissolubilis? aut quid
est, cuius principium aliquod sit, nihil est extremum? The argument
ol this paragraph is precisely the same as that ol Epicurus, who “says
that the worlds are perishable because their parts undergo change”
(μεταβαλλόντων τῶν pepon„ see Diog. Laert. 10, 74.

(1) Earth is mortal ,· some of it, parched hy the seen ond trodden hy
the fen, is scottered hy the wind ; sonnis worn away hy streams.
It is the mother and ot the same time the common tomb eff all
things. 247-260.

(2) Watn3 too, is perishable; the sea, streoms, ond springs ore always
ouerflowing wilh new wyplies, while the sum is coer the same,· .
sor wind and sun take owoy a part, ond a part through the
earth finds its way back to the sources of rehem, 261-272.

(3) The air, likewae're, r's hourly changing; for into r't goes whatever
posses eff from things, ond unless it gave boch matter to things
they would all be turned into air. 27 3-280.

(4) And fire also ; sor the mn is always sending forth new light, ond
thot which stauos from it perishes. os when o cloud comcs between
it and us the light below disappears ,¹ so lomps are constantly sup
plying the ploce of old light with new; the same must he thought

true os the heoverely bodies. 281-305.
