280 LUCRE'l’lUS [1. 863-

863. osse: i.e., corpora parva, or corpuscula, ouium.- partis: ie..
particulas. 864. liquor: for liquidus (cibus). 865. alienigenis:
‘different in kind‚' ‘foreign in kind‚’ the opposite, as Munro remarks,
to huoroprphr. The argument is, that food does not consist of minute
particles oi like nature with itself, as the doctrine oi Anax. requires,
but of particles os blood, bone, etc, things foreign to it in kind. And
likewise the earth is composed not of minute portione of earth, but
of particles that go to make up all the things that grow out oi it. So
again in wood flame-particles lurk. 868. terrisr the pl. brings out
the idea of ‘parts' or ‘portione of earth'; ‘earths' 870. transfer:
imperior protasis of cond. sentence, ‘apply’ (ie. if you apply) the
same reasoning. 873-4. These lines, as they stand, are meaning·
less. Lachmann reads 874 Δ

ex alienigenis, quae alienigenis oriuntur,

which is not at all clean Munro supposes that aiter 873 there is
a break, which he thus bridges over, simply adding his to 874 as it
stands in the uss:

ex alienigenis quae tellure exoriuntur.
sic itidem quae ligna emittunt corpora, aluntur
ex alienigenis, quae lignis his oriuntur.

This, at least, makes good sense and completes the argument.

But Anaxagoras assumes that while in things all sarrs (γ’ absume:
are miugled, only that &comes apparent of which the particles are most
numerous aud conspicuous ,· the others, as it were, lie hid. Que'te wrong.
For, ou this supposition, when things are crushed, minute partiales of

dfierent substancer ought to appear. 87 5-896.

875. ‘ Here some slight opportunity is given for evasion.’-tenvis:
a dissyllahle, as often in poetry. 878. plurima: supply corpora
parva or corpuscula. 881. conveniebat: trans. as if subj.; so 884
decebat. Α. 311, c ,⁰ G. 246, Rem. r; H. 476, 4. 883. aliquid: sup·
ply eorum. 885. lapidi: abl. 886. latices: i‚e., “the waters
that the sheep drink.” 887. Lachmann, followed by Munro, thus
explains the consta: dulces guttas mittere (tales) quali oues sunt ubere
Iactis,· “ubere is hriefly said for sapore uberis.” 892. praefr.
forent: observe the subj, while above in 882 franguntur and 885
