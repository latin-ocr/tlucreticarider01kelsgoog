agoras taught that there is an indefinite number oi primitive sub
stances, qualitatively different, corresponding to all the various kinds
of matter. Thus, fiesh is made up ot minute particles oi fiesh, bone
oi particles ot bone, gold ol gold, and so forth These particle· are
underived and indestructible. They are not, however, atoms, tor they
are infinitely divisible. The four elemeuts he thought to be merely a
mixture oi all kinds oi primitive particles; their “apparent simple·
nese he explains by saying that, on account ot the amalgamation ot
all possible determinate substances, not one ol these is perceived in
its distinctive individuality, but only that is perceived in which they
ali agree.” To explain the union of these in living bodies. and the
creation and ongoing oi the universe, Anaxagoras taught the exist·
enee oi a Νοῦς, an incorporenl, intelligent Force, acting upon matter
from without. He was the first who grasped at the idea of essential
difference between matter and spirit; at the conception also of an
intelligent Final Canse. It is an error, however, to suppose that
Anaxagoras believed in the Notis as a personality, as au infinite, all·
perfect God. See Zeller, ‘Prae-Soc. Phil! vol. ii.-homoeomerian:
εὸμαιομὸρειαν, and so written in some tiss. and older edit.; ‘homoeo-
meria’ Anax. called his primitive particles πέμματα ‘seeds' or χρή-
ματα ‘things ’ς ὁμοιομερῆ ‘oi like parts' does not occur iu the trag-
ments ot Anax. extant, but is first found in Aristotle; whether it or
ὁμοιομέρειαι was used by Anax. is an open question. The latter term
isfirst met with in this passage, and seems to denote “the relation
which existed between the things in being and the partiens, like in
kind, oi which they were composed,” as suggesting the doctrine oi
simple substances composed ot parts infinitely small. In later Greek
writers ai ὁμοιομέρειαι is used in describing the system ot Anam, as by
Diog. Laert. 2,8 οὗτοι {haye-..ends bd eds ὁμοιομερείας·
