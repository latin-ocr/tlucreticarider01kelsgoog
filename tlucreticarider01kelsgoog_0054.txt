111. LUCRETIUS AS A POET.

(i.) Lnamnr Cunnacranrsnoe or rna Da Rmuu Nlmm

Before attempting to form an estimate oi Lucretius’ poetic
power it is necessary to inquire, first, whether the poem stands
to-day as it was leit by him; and, secondly, whether it passed
trom the author’s hands as a finished work.

itis well established that all the existing manuscripts oi the
poem come from one original manuscript, known as the arche·

V type. This was lost long ago. From the iact that all copies

arcto be' traced to one exemplar, it is obvious that wherever
that was incorrect the error has been perpetuated, 3ηά is not to
be remedied by comparison with other manuscripts. Thus it
happens that in all the texts there are certain breaks and corrupt
passages, which have taxed the utmost ingenuity of commenta·
tors, without any certainty in the end of presenting what the
poet wrote. Lucretius, moreover, was one whose views the mon·
astery copyists would not be apt to approve ol. For this reason,
there have crept iu many interpolations 3ηά transpositions oi
passages intended either to reiute the argument or show the
poet's inconsistency by quoting him against himseli. These
errors, as well as the unavoidable blunders that abound in
manuscripts, have been mostly corrected by the able critical
scholars who have given their attention to the text, and now
“the great mass of the poem ’¹ is “in 3 sound and satisfactory
state;‘’ but in some places the thought oi the poet cannot be
detertnined. ι

As before remarked, there is evidence to prove that at the
poet’s death his work had not yet received the finishing touches.
ln the last three books especially there are awkward sentences,
ill-arranged passages, and weak repetitions 3 occasionally whole
paragraphs are met with that ill suit the connection andare
