5²⁸· plagis: blows, or impact ot atoms, end masses, held a very
important place in the Epicurean philosophy, both in the explanation
ol the natural processes oi growth and decay and in the doctrine ot
sense-perception. 531. See 485 et seq. 53²· conlidi: ‘crushed
together: ‘crushed in.' 533. bina: ‘into two parts,’ ‘in two'3
rarely used as here without a substantive. 534. manabile: found
only here 3 = penetrale. 537. tamz ior eo, to correspond with quo.
-his rebus: ie. umore, frigore, igni, the three great disintegrating
agencies. Amodernphysicist would add electricity. 540. iuis
set: the imper. tense might have been expected, as indestructibility
is an essential, ever-present quality ol matter, ‘it matter were not,’ etc.
But the plup. is more logical, the implication being, ‘if matter from
infinite past time had not been,' etc. In the expression ol general
truths, however, the Latin tense-idiom is at variance with the English.
For the thought cl. Epicurus in Diog. laert. 10, 24, 55 ‘It is necessary
' that something remain indestructible that all things may not be re·
duced into nonexistence! 543. supra: 150 (where see n.) etseq.
546 quo : =in quoe. 548. solida . . . simpl: ‘solid singleness‚’ a
phrase often used by Lucr, by which he torcibly suggests not simply
the impenetrability, hut also the individuality, as it were, the dis-
tinct separate existence ol the atoms. 549. aevom: ‘eternity’
This word is used by Lucr. also to express limited time, as below
553 aevo priore ‘the past,’ 564 oevi ‘ life-span,' ‘age' ¹

55ι. Denique: as in 199 where see n. 554. a cer. temp:
‘within a fixed time) 555. summum . . . auctum: ‘reach its
utmost growth oi being* auctum is Munro’s emend. torſsnem, which
is obviously wrong; tor finis elsewhere in Lucr. is fem, and besides
here does not suit the sense. Lachm. reads conceptum summa aetatis
peruadere finis. 557. diei: ‘length' ‘period' depends on aetas
‘duratium’ and is limited in turn by temporis. Munro, however, says
