LUCRETIUS AS A POET li

recognition nithe same principle that leads the epic poets to
rush in medias res, leaving the less important or preceding
matters to be presented later by narration. The details, like
the general plan, are frequently arranged by the poet with the
same sense ol poetic fitness. The points that go to establish
an argument are artistically put in anay. While the form ot
statement is so varied as not to give the impression ol a logi-
cal series, they ascend with cumulative force, often coming to
an end with a sharp appeal to common serpe or an ironical
illustration to silence the unconvinced. At times, however,
cold logie dominates, and the poet siuks almost to the level of

prose.
Lucretius’ manner os expression is plain, direct, and lorcible.

The poets in whom he seems most to have delighted were
Homer, Euripides, Empedocles (styled Homeric by Aristotle)
and Ennius. He had also read much Cicero's ‘Aratea,'—a
work in places exceedingly spirited and apt in expression. But
while Lucretius occasionally shows the influence of other

writers, his style has a marked individuality. There is little of
the ‘highest art that conceals art3' ¹there is rather the vigor ot
· native genius that cared nothing lor beauty ol expression ior its
own sake, but merely sought tor a form of language that could

in some degree convey the vividness ol conception. Hence he
did not hesitate to coin new words; and some ol the com-
pounds he formed are ol rare expressiveness. Poetic pleon-
asms, by which he gave prominence to a conception in holding
it before the thought, are common enough, but while his range
of epithets is large, he never lavishes them needlessly. Tech-
nical terms, considering the character of his subject, are tew;
and owing to the almost epic simplicity and directness oi state·
ment, the most subtle arguments are set forth with clearness
and accuracy of expression. Yet little obscurlties, which some·
times arise from the use nithe same word in different senses
and srom the formos the construction, he passes over without
heed. The epic tone ol the poem is heightened by the not
infrequent use of archaisms.
