A.T111Er1cunenrt view. 483-634

1. Atotns, oi which matter is made up, are solid,
without void. 483-527.

stat there is ansthing absolutely solid is not known from the senses,
but through reason. 483-502.

483 etseq. That these lines embody the view oi Democritus is
apparent from Diog. Laert. 9, 44. The thought is exactly that oi
Epicurus id. 10, 24, 40-41: ‘Oi bodies some, indeed, are combina-
tions, others are (the elements) out oi which the combinations have
been made. The latter now are indivisible (ἄτομα) ond unchange·
able; else indeed all things would be reduced to nonexistence. But
oi their own power in the dissolution oi the combinations they sur·
vive, because in their nature they are iuli, and thus show no aspect oi
weakness‚ nor any mode in which they can be destroyed. Therefore,
oi necessity the first principles oi things are indivisible bodies! Cf.
the statement ot Sir Isaac Newton: “It seems probabis that God
in the beginning formed matter in solid masses, hard, impenetrable,
moveable particles of such size, figures, and with such other proper·
ties and in such proportions to space, as most conduced to the end
ior which he formed them; and that these primitive particles‚ being
solid, are incomparably harder than any porous body compounded
oi them, -even so very hard as never to wear or to break in pieces.'’
See Lange, ‘Hist oi Materialism,' section 3, ch. 3; ‘Popular Science
Monthly,' 1881, p. 837. Ci. also Herbert Spcncer, ‘Prin oi Psychol·
ogy,’ 3d Am. edit. i. 155: “There is reason to suspect that the so·
called simple substances are themselves compound; and that there is
but one ultimate iorm oi matter, out oi which the successively more
complex iorms oi matter are built up. By the different grouping oi
units, and by the combinations oi the unlike groups each with its own
kind and each with other kinds, it is supposed that there have been
produced the kinds oi matter we call elementary; just as, by further
composition simultaneously carried on, these produce further varie·
ties and complexities.” See also Zeller, ‘ Prae-Socrat Phil! ii. 220-1,
228; Tyndall, ‘Fragments oi Science,’ 5th edit. p. 475. Consult
