earth aethe parentsoi all, when now the old religione becanm a thing
oi the past, abandoned as superstitious by the higher classes of soci-
ety to the ignorant and credulous, the iorms oi worship were still
kept up. Many, indeed, particularly the Stoics, tried by rationalistic
explanatione to adapt the old mytbs about gods and heroes to their
philosophie views. Ci. eg. 2, 652-660. But they were inwrought into
the tolle-tite ol both Greece and Rome. Attempts to explain them to
accord with natural law were never popular. Fiually, discarded as
beliefs they remained as poetry. To Ennius, Lucretius, to Catullus,
Vergil and Horace, gods arrd goddesses were but stuff lor poetry,—
conceptions about which were gathered associations bright and beauti-
iul, or sad and stern, traditions of power and passion that gave scope
for all sorts oi poetic license. But in this and like passages the per·
sonification oi sky and earth doubtless meant far more to Lucr. than
to most ot his contemporaries, on account oi its philosophical signiti-
cance. Under the beauty oi description lies a deep and wide-reaching
truth. Cf. n. on 2 Venus. ²51· matris terrai. Ci. 2, 589-6603
5, 821; Vergil has imitated this passage, Georg. 2, 325-7:

Tum pater omnipotens temnet· imbribus aether

Coniugis in gremium laetae descendit, et omnia

Magnus alit, magno commixtus corpore, letus.

25³· ipsae: supply arbores. Ci. 35² totas and n. 355 pueris:

‘children’ Florere, meaning ‘to abound with,’ is followed by the
ordinary constr. with verbs oi plenty. Ci. 5, ¹44²· ²57· pingui:
substantive in the abl, lirniting J‘essac. 2⁶0. antibus: Lucr. has
artibus but once, 5, 1077. 261. mentesa tor corda or pectora.
Cf. r, 13. 262. penitus: see n. to 145. videntur: supply
perire. 263. alid ε 3 collateral formos aliud, like ala'r for alius, ali
ior alii. See Roby, 3733 Neue, ‘Formenlehre‚' ii. ²14 In the time
oi Lucr. these forms were already archaic. See Draeger, ‘Hist Syn-
tax d. Lat. Sprache,’ Einl. p. xii. 264 morte...aliena: i.e.
alterius rei interint, as Lambinus explains. That the death oi one
thing is the birth oi another was a maxim ot the ancient physicists.
Munro quotes one form of it in Greek from Arist. Met, 2, 2, p. 994,
b, 5ἡ θατέρου φθορὰ θατέρου ἐστὶ γένεσις. Oi the doctrine itseli he
well remarks that “as here applied to this world oi ours, it is perhaps
hardly consistent with what is said below 556, that the process of
destruction is much quicker than that oi construction. Elsewhere
Lucr. argues at great length and with much earnestness that this
