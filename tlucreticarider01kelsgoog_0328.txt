As atonrs, which lie beyond the hen gf sense, are parts as things, so the
atnns themselves are compared as parts ,⁸ hut with this difference. the
parts os the atone are absolutely limited r‘n size and are inseparablesrom
ane another, haw'ng existed s'n arrian frans all eternity, so that the atone
cannot be broken up, hut remains a unit (599-614). Furthermore, is the
ptam were infinr'tely dr'err'sr'hle there would he no differente between the
least thing and the greatest, since both alike wareld be compared os irrfinite
parts, and thus he equa! (615-627); ifthe atone were dr'rrided into the
least parts, these could not haue the properties which matter, tofarrn the
basis as existence, must have (628-634).

599-608. This passage is exceedinglydifficult. Munro’s explanation
is the best. After 599 he thinks two lines have been lost, and thus fills
out the senses ‘Then again, since there is ever a bounding-point [to
bodies, which appears to us to be a least, there ought in the same way
to be a bounding-point the least conceivable] to that first body, which
is already beyond what our senses can percelve: that point sure enough
is without parts ' ete ooo. corporis: i.e., the atom. On the view
that the atom can be known not by sense but by reason, see Zeller,
‘Prae-Socrat. Phil! ii. 219, ²²5 and nn. with references to original au·
thorities; Id. ‘Stoica Ep, and Scep.' p. 442. Cf. Tyndall‚ ‘Frag ot
Sci! p. 7¹ : “ Indeed the domain oi the senses in Nature is almost in·
finitely small in comparlson with the vast region to thought which lies
beyond them.” 601. id: ie. cacumen ‚· ‘it has no parts, but is itselt
one ol the parts ot the atom, having no conceivable existence apart from
the atom.’ - extat := ert. 604-5. ‘and so a first and single part,
and then other and other similar parts in succession, fill up in close
serried mass the nature ot the first body' (corporis, the atom). The
