Lucnnrrus ns n roas xlix

clearly out of place, probably inserted by the poet as a make·
shilt till some better setting could be found ior them. The
allusion to Cicero’s editorship in the passage from Jerome
quoted above has given rise to much discussion ; some, as Lach-
mann, think that Quintus Cicero is referred to, while Munro
aud others suppose that the orator is meant of course Jerome
had the orator in mind, for in his day as now, when Cicero
was spoken oi, men thought oi the great Cicero. Although
there is some reason lor supposing that Quintus acted as editor
oi the poem, it is iar more likely that the task tell upon Marcus,
who “may have spent only a lew hours in looking over it or
hearing it read to him; his name rather than his time was prob-
ably wanted hy the friends oi Lucretius.'' At any rate the
poem seems to have been “given to the world exactly as it was ¹
leit by the author, with nothing added or taken from it to all
appearance.'’ Thus says the highest critical authority upon the
text, and his statement may be sustained by many evidences
which itis not necessary to present. Suffice it to say that not-
withstanding the uncompleted state oi the poem, and the hope·
less corruptions and lacunae, there is manifest a literary ability
unexcelled by that of any Latin writer. ln the uniolding and
treatment os the organic idea, as well as in the manner oi ex·
pression and the music ol the verse, poetic genius oi a high
order is revealed.

The De Rerum Natura is a didactic poem with an ethical
'purpose The organic idea is,-without the activity or inter-
vention oi any divine power the processes ol nature and oi lile
ever go on. The purpose is,-t0 iree men from the ills oi
superstition. Herein is sounded the key-note oi the whole.

The aim and the organic idea are never lost sight oi. Hence

the poem possessos unity3 the parts all fit into a general plan. ¹
There is something like an epic movement, which does not
come from the verse alone, but irorn the onward sweep ol
thought. Especially in certain passages about lile and death
and the actions oi men, and in some descriptions oi changes,
the true epic spirit is ielt.
