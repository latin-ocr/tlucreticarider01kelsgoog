926-7. Death is less to us than sleep, if there can be a less than

nothing. The Epicureans thought that in sleep a portion ot the soul ’

left the body. Literatnre is tull oi passages based upon the likeness
oi death to sleep. The conception of sleep, as the brother of death,
goes, back as iar as Homer; see 11. 16, 682; Shelley, ‘Queen Mab,’
1st stanza3 Lessing, ‘How the Ancients represented Death.' Cf.
Cic. De Sen. 22, 80 iam vero videtis nihil esse marti tam simile quam
somnum,' Id. Tusc. Disp. 1, 38, 92 quid curet autem, qui ne sentit qui·
dem? hahes somnum imaginem mortis eamque cotidie r'riduis, et dubitas
quin senuas in marte nullus sit, crem in eius simulacro videas esse nullum
sensum? Both Lucretius and Cicero seem to have been thinking of
the heavy, dreamless sleep, and were not troubled with the apprehen·
sions that vexed Hamlet :-

“Todie,-tosleep:-
To sleep 1 perehance, to dream r ay, there ’s the ruht
For in that sleep os death what dreams may come,
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Must give us pause.”

Cf. the ‘Systeme de la Nature,' part 1, ch. 13: “But does not a
proiound sleep help to give him a true idea ot this nothing? Does ·
not that deprive him ot everything? Does it not appear to annihilare

the universe to him, and him to the universe? Is death anything
more more than a protound a permanent sleep?”

(6) What could we say, save that her cause is just, if Nature should

thus address us: way, Omartal, grieve that thau must die? If a glad ’

lise has been thy lat, why nat depart content? if lise is irksame, why nat
end it? Shmeldst thau trever die there is nothingnew in starefor thee!

If au ald man should maurn at death, would she not rightly chade?-
‘Hence with thy tears, trister! thau hast let thy life stip away a sitilure,
the siaulta's thine marm· make raam for others! Ta none is life given in

perpetuity. As the past was besuae aur birth, sa shall the fieture he aflet
death. 931·977· .
