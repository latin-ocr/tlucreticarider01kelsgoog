pi. sooetscq. For the argument cf. Epicurus in Diog. Laert 10, 24,
65-6 ‘The rest of the body, remaining either as a whole or in part,
does not retain its feeling after the dispersion of that combination of
atonis whatever it may be, that forms the soul. Moreover, when the
whole body is dissolved the soul is dispersed, and no longer has
the same powers nor motions, so that it no longer has feeling. For
it is inconceivable that the soul possesses feeling when not having
those wonted motions in that organic system (formed by itsclf in
union with the body), when its environment and surroundings are
not such that in their midst it can retain those motions’ ς also, the
‘Systeme de la Nature,’ Part 1, ch. ι 3: ‘⁸ indeed, by what reasoning
will it be proved that the soul, which cannot feel, think, will or act
but byaid of man's organs, can suffer pain, be susceptible to plensure,
or even have a consciousness of its own existence, when the organs
that should uvarn it‘ot their presence are decomposed or destroyed?”
564. seorsum: used as a prep. with the abl. in the sense of se, sine
