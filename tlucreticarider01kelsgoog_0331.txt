mutation and mixture of resulting substances the world is made up;
but there is constant change from one state or form of matter to
another; and at the close of a fixed cycle of ages all things are re-
solved back again into the primal essence,-the universe becomes a
vast chaos of waving flame. Agaln, the process of transmutation and
the unstable equilibrium of opposites in oue substance will produce
another world; and so ou through the innumerable cycles of eternity.
This theory of Heraclitus, with some changes, was adopted by the
Stoics as the basis of their physics. The best account of H. is
by Zeller, ‘Prae-Soc. Phil’ vol. ii. Consult also Ueberweg, ‘Hist
of Phil! vol. i.; Ritter, ‘Hist of Anc. Phil! vol. i.; Lcwes,
‘Biog¹ Hist. of Phil' - quorum: a school of Heracliteans existed
for several generations after the death of H. But the reference
is here more particularly to the Stoics‚ whom Lucr. takes every
opportunity to attack. For the reason that in this discussion of
Heraclitus he is combating his most earnest opponents the poet
waxes far more ardent than in his later criticisms of Empedocles and
Anaxagoras. ⁶39· obscuram linguam: the darkness of meaning
in the utterances of Heraclitus gained for him the epithetd σκοτεινάς
‘the obscure! See Arist. De Mundo 5, 5; cf. Cic. De Fin. a, 5, 15

by some that he did not wish to express himself clearly lest his views,
being opposed to the religious ideas of the time, call down persecu·
tion upon him. But in the fragments of his writings that have come
down to us he is singularly outspoken. And while his obscurity is
often alluded to by the ancients, he is never charged by them with
intent to be obscure. Lucretius, indeed, rather pays him a compli-
ment by implying that heis difficult to understand only to the ‘light-
minded’ Greeks. Like the old man in Wordsworth‚ he coined his
thought in “phrase above the reach Of ordinary men.'’ 64u
quamde: archaic for quom ‘tham’ formed by adding the particle -de
found in unde, ira-de, and the like. Qrmmde is also found twice in the
fragments of EnniuS, and once in Naevius. 642. inv. . . . verb: in·
vertere verbo sometimes means to use words in unusual or wrong sense.
Here more likely the reference is to the arrangement; ‘involved
language.’ ⁶43· vera: ‘as truc ’3 supply ea. -bel tang: 'pret-
