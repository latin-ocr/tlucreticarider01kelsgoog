eludes not merely the streets of cities, but also the paved highways,
as the Via Apph. —propterz see nto 90. ³¹7· signa: statues
ol the gods were often placed near the city gates to receive the wor-
ship ot those who entered. See Pausanias 4, 33, ᾗ 4. This custonr is
thought to explain the reference in Acts 14, 13 ,ὅ τε ἱερεὺς τοῦ Διὸς τοῦ
ὄντος orph τῆς πόλεως, ταύρους καὶ στέμματα ἐπὶ τοὺς πυλῶνας ἐνέγκας,
σὺν τοῖς ὄχλοις ἤθελεν θύειν. The Greeks appear'to have touched or
kissed the chin ot statues, the Romans the right hand. Α parallel to
the fact noticed by Lucr.maybe seen in many European churches and
cathedrals. The right foot ot the bronze statue of St. Peter in
St. Peter’s at Rome is almost entirely worn away by the kisses ot
devotees. 318. salutantum. . . meantum: hysteron proteron.
For the spelling see n. to 1, 4 animantum ; praeterque meantum, perhaps
a tmesis3 but see n. to 66 contra. 32¹· speciem r = visum ‘the '
nature ot vision has jealously shut out our seeing! 322. dies: as
in 233· 326. vesco: ‘corroding’ Vescus, connected in derivatlon
with vescor (ared-co, vers-co, vesco, Vanitek,‘Etym. worth! p. 28),
has lost the active sense except here and in a very lew other pas·
sages. See Munro’s note. 327. quoque: quoque, as above 320.
32⁸· natura gerit: see n. to 56. The metaphor here, as Mumo
remarks, is taken from the government ol a state.

are acted on. 3²9·417·

bodies into them or through them (346-357). Things (γ’ the same siae

329· stipata: ‘packed together'; a common word in Lucr. 330.
inane: asubstantive,=rh κενόν, which was defined by Arist. (Phys.
4, 1, 6) as rhosos ἐστερημένος σώματος, ‘place devoid of body? For
‘void' Luer. also has vacuum, once vacans in 444 inane vacansque.
He uses also spatium, locus, and the like, but less definitely, to desig·
nate the room or space in which things exist. 331. in mul. rebus:
‘in many respects.’ 333. summa rerum: here = the universe.
334 This line is doubtless spurious. It was first rejected by Bent-
ley. 335. quod esset : i. e. inane existeret. 336. officium: ‘property’
