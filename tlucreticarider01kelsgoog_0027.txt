LUCRETIUS AS A PHILOSOPHER xxi

of atoms of medium weight. The heaviest oi themselves drew
together, giving rise to the earth; as this became compact, light,
round partic'les were squeezed out into the hollow places, making
thesea. The earth, formerly moving about, is now stationary,
at the centre of the world; it has the shape oi a flat cylinder.

For the gods the system of Democritus left no room. But in
the course of nature he recognized something that be called

universe, the law of necessity.

The soul, said Democritus, is the noblest part of man. The
