pars. In cases like this pars takes the meaning oi ‘one-hall,’ ‘one-
third ’ etc. according to the context. 618. praefiniet: ‘set bounds’

future of esse, inchoative in origin. It is found four times in the frag·

reasoning in 615-622 was horrowed hythe Epicuream [τοττι the
Eleatics. Granted that matter is infinitely divisible, the least thing
as well as the greatest will be made up oi an infinite number ot parts;
thus there will be no difference between them, because infinities are
equal. Exactly the same was the view oi the Indian materialist
Kanada, who taught that ii matter were infinitely divisible a grain
of sand would be “equal to a mountain, both being infinite.’' See
Fleming, ‘Vocah oi Phil! art. A tom. The argument is a paralogism,
as has often been shown. It assumes that anything which can be
divided into an infinite number ot parts is infinite, and that all infini-
ties are equal, We conceive of space, ior example, as infinitely
divisible3 hence any measure in space, as a mile, an inch, is infi-
nitely divisible3 but the mile and the inch are not therefore equal
divisions oi space. 625. ea: refers to the parts oi the atoms; so
quae in 626. 627. illa: i.e., the atoms: quoque, ie. as well as the
inseparable parts oi which atoms are made up. 632. possunt:
supply bahem ‘cannot have those properties which ' etc. The argu·
ment in 628-634 must be careiully distinguished from that ot Demo·
critus horrowed from Zen0, “that an absolute division would leave
no magnitude remaining, and therefore nothing at all.” See Zeller,
‘Prae-Soc. Phil! ii. 219. ln illustration ot our poet's position
Munro quotes Maxwell, ‘Theory oi Heat,' p. 285: “We do not assert
that there is an absolute limit to the divisibility oi matter3 what we
assert is that aiter we have divided a body into a certain finite num·
ber oi constituent parts called molecules, then any iurther division oi
these molecules will deprive them oi the properties which give rise

’ to the phenomena observed in the substance.” On the value oi the

argument see Stallo, 'Concepts and Theories oi Mod. Phys’ ch. 7.
