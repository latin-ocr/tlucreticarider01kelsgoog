Introd. The conception nithe Divine and the beliei in a hereaiter are ’
deeply impressed upon the constitution oi man. Itis a characteristic
oi human nature to hate one whom you have injured (Tac. Agr. 42).
The Epicureans, however sincere may have been their search aster the
truth, in doing violence to the instinctive outreaching ot the soul aiter
God and immortality, ielt enraged at the manifestation in others oi
those belieis they themselves affected to contemn. The spirit oi this
passage is well shown by Taylor Lewis, ‘Plato against the Atheists,'

Excursus liin: “The very efforts of the Epicureans to ridicule the
vulgar iears, and to make light ot the terrors of the unseen Hades, show

a secret trepidation, and, instead oi philosophie indifference, manifests
that bitter hatred which proceeds irom a mind at once deeply troubled‚
anxious, and yet unable to shake off those fears which its philosophy
affects to despise.'’ Hence the repetition throughout the poem of the
indifference oi the gods regarding the affairs ot men, and the ground-
