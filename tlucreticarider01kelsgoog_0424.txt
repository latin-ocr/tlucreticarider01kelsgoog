resistance oi the air, orto the fact that being on fire they have need of
suitable matter, and that this gives out, or lastly to the fact that in the
beginning they received an impulse that compels them to move describ-

oi the sun and moon, the ancients were not at all agreed.

(5) Nrght comes either because the firesoj the nm are burned out or
because it turns its course under the carth (650-5). Day follows, when
tle sun returns from under tlte earth to ils course above, or because new
fires at a fixed time havegathered ,· for martyr things hoppen at regular
intervals (656-679). Days and nights vary r’n length either sor tlte rea·

cists lor the most part made out that the sun is a fiery body or mass ot
flames confined, and that night is caused by the dip oi the sun in its
circular orbit under the earth. Anaximenes, however, said that night
results from the going oi the sun behind the northern mountains.
With the alternatives proposed by Lucr. ci. Epicurus, Diog. Laere

heaveniy bodies, may take place on account ol their being kindled‚
and dying out ; and in other ways they may be produced, as in the
cases previously mentioned, tor the appearances manifest to the senses
