all uncompounded matter. . . . Now if compound bodies are so very
hard as we find some ot them to be, and yet are very porous and con-
sist oi parts which are only laid together, the simple particles which
are void oi pores and were never yet divided must be much hardes.
For such hard particles being heaped together can scarce touch one
another in more than a lew points, and therefore must be separable
by much less force than is requisite to break a solid particle whose
parts touch in all the space between thern without any pores or inter·
stices to weaken their cohesion.” Emerson represents nature as
sayingr-
⁸⁸ No ray is gone, no stom worn,
My oldest force is old aa new,

And the fresh rose on yonder thorn
Gives back the bending heaveus in dew.”

Suppose there is no linit to the dt'visr'bility gf matter; still there ore
elements rsot as yet reduced, of which all things that exist are composed.
But these, unless indestructshle, emeld net hove withstood the forces eff dis·
solution from infinite past time (577-583). All nature is under the resgn
us law. This could not be is there were not in matter elements imapable

of change er decay ( 584-598).

matter is infinitely divisible. The argument is a kind oi reductio

but may be readily supplied. 584. generatim: see n. to 20.
586. quid. . . queant: queo and possum are olten used absolutely in
the sense ot qu. facere or agere, possae. or agere. In construing quid
and the like in such cases, instead ot supplying facere, as is often done,
it is better to consider them as adverbial acc. A like constr. is met
with in other languages. For the English cf. Browning ‘A Death in
the Desert,' “Lower than God, who knows all and can all ;” Bacon, .
‘Essay on Great Place,' “the best condition is not to will, the second
not to can; ” Shakspere ‘Hamlet,’ “The French, who can well on
horse-back.”-ioedera naturai: the conception ot law, universal,
