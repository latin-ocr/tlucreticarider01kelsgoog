iorm is frequently met with in inscriptions and in Prae-Augustam
poetry, sometimes even in the later poets.

(6) The spontaneam products of the earth would fier uerpass those
cherished by human toil. 208-214.

208. postremo: notice with what slrill the poet varies the words
introducing the various points, so that a lormal enumeration is pre·
served without marring the poetic effect, 174 praeterea, 184 nec perro,
192 huc. 199 denique, 208 postremo. ως. manibus: not dat, but
abl. ol means or instrument. ato. esse etc: supply fatendum est.
213. quaeque: see n. to 1²9·

²15· corpora: lor corpora primu—dissoluat: generally aiter q,
g, s, I, and r the semi-vowel v has the force of a consonant. But in
soluere and compounds, and a lew other words, it is often treated by
the poets as a vowel. Thus here dustlhat. For other exceptione
cl. nn. to 560 relicu'o ; 5, 679 conseque. Suemus (1, 603 1, 301 and often)
is sometimes pronounced as a dissyllable, sometimes as a trisyl-
lable. See Roby, 94, 2. 216. interemat: this spelling, ior the
classical period, rests on better uss. authority than interimat, though
Brambach (‘ Latin Orthography' Trans, p. 97) and the Latin diction·

view oi the indestructibility ol matter see nn. to 150, 483.

217-8. Ch the argument oi Epicurus: ‘And if that which disap
pears were destroyed into the non-existent, all things would perish
utterly, since there would not be things into which they could be
resolved' (Diog. Laert, ιο, 24, 39 nul εἴ ἐφθείρετο tl rt ὀφιυιζόμενον
εἷς rh μὴ hu, edm hu ἀπολώλει τὰ πράγματα, οὐκ ὄντων τῶν eis h

aar. quod nunc. ‘whereas in truth’ forms a transition from the
