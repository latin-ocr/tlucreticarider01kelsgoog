§ 365. Lucr. has deorum but once (ὁ, 54), though dabam aud deum are
found many times without differencc of meaning. The poet's choico
between the different forms was perhaps governed by the metre-
voluptas: Venus as goddess of love could with propriety be called
hominurn divomque voluptas ,· lor the ancient mythology pictured the
gods with the same joys and passions as men. See the striking pas·
sage in Cic. N. D. 1, 16, 42. Cf. 6, 94 requies hominum drbomque
voluptas, where Calliope is invoked. a. alma: ‘increasegiving'
The gliding movement oi the verse well suits the sense.

Venus: the Epicureans believed not at all in the influence ot the
Divine over the affairs of men. Why, then, does Lucretius begin his
poem with an invocation to Venus? The question is not an easy one
to answer. It was the custom oi the poets to preiace any important
work with an address to the gods or some particular divinity lor
inspiration. Prose writers, too, sometimes followed their example.
Varro opens the ‘De Re Rustica· with a labored prayer to the gods
oi the iarmer. Whatever may have been the motive of such invo-
cations at first, aiter the decline oi the old religion in Greece and
Rome to educated readers and hearers they no longer suggested
any thought of the real presence ol the Divine; they furuished merely
an occasion ior the dignified display oi a bit of literary finery. Hence
the spiritless invocation of Ovid at the beginning oi the Metamor-
phoses; instances of the like, with many others, some graceiul and
some dull, may be found in the writings oi his contemporaries and
the poets ot the decline. Oi similar character is Lucretius’ address
to Calliope, quoted above. But while Lucretius in thus opening bis
poem was coniorming to the example of the poets from Homer to
Ennius, with him it was not a matter oi display or trifling. These
lines breathe an intense earnestness. Filled with bright images‚ they
hurry the thought along with resistless force. What, then, the secret
ol their power?

Lucretius conceived oi the world as under the reign ol law (sec
u. to 1, 586). Not chance, but fixed orden—inconsistent as this
may appear by the side of his doctrine of the atom, -seemed to him
the key to the mysteries oi the operations oi nature. To him, as
to thinking men ol all ages, the strangest thing in all the mecha·
