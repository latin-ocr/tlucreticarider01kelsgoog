220 cucnerrus [1. 4-

direct exercise of power-qnoniam etc: this clause (often misun-
derstood) stands, in thought as in position, closely connected with corr·
celebras. — animantum: stems in i preceded by a dental, except those·
of one syllable, are sometimes in the poets found with gen. pl. in am.
'l'he reason may lie in the requirements of the verse, though parem
and a few others have the gen. pl. in -um in prose. Cicero wrote am‘·
montium. Cf. n. to 3, 573. 5. exortumr‘rising up'into exist-
ence. Exerfri is often employed by Lucr. in this philosophie sense.—
lumina: poetic use of pl. where prose and the English idiom would
prefer the sing. Perhaps there is in the pl. a distributive force that
brought before the Latin mind the conception of rays.

6. caeli, 7. tellus, 8. ponti: the three grand divisione of the uni·
verse, frequently met with in classical and even in modern writers.
By considering coelum as eomposed of αι”ν and mlier, the atmos·
phere and the pure upper air, the poet elsewhere assumes the four·
fold structure of the world recognized by philosophers and poets
alike. This last division is closely connected wlth the idea of the
four primal elements, earth, water, air, and fire, which aiter the time
of Empedocles, held so important a place in cosmological specula-
tions. Ovid also, in his account of the creation (Met. 1, 1-124), first
mentions the three parts of the universe, then the four. Cf. ²·3r
above; 5, 416-17, 449, et seq.; r, 714 etseq. 7. suavis: Lucr, as
the other Latins of the classica] period, wrote the aec. pl. of i-stems
in -es or -rs indifferently. The ending -eis, rarely found except in Prae·
Augustan inscriptions, was incorrectly printed in old editions. Cf.
srrgnserente's above-daedala: the epithct may refer either to the
earth's power of manifold productiori, or to its variegated appearance
resulting therefrom. Edd. quote here the explanation of ‘Paulus
ex Festo‚’ p. 68, 6, daedalum a varietate rerum ardr'ficiorumque dietam
esse apud Lucretium ferram, apud Ennium Minervam, apud Vergiliana
Circen, facile est intellegere, cum Graece δαιδάλλειν significet variare.
Tc: ‘manifold bf works,' a meaning that well suits the active force of
summittit. Cf. 5, 234 natura daedala rerum 4, 551 verborum daedala
lingua. 8. rident: a favorite word of our poet. Cf. 5, 1004-5, and n.
ro. April as the first month of Spring was regarded by the Romans
as sacred to Venus. So in all ages spring-time and Love have been
associated. Cf. the graceful lines of Tennyson in ‘Loeksley Hali!-
