240 LUCRETIUS [1. 159-

It was often omitted also in the older inscriptions, as those of the
Scipios. At that time to glide over the final s in speaking was re-
garded as a mark oi refinement, —as, indeed, it seems to be considered
by some to·day; but when Cicero wrote it was already in bad taste.
Ci. Cic. Orator 161 quin enom, quodiam subrustrorm videtur, olim autem
politius, corvam verborum, quorum eaedem erant postremae duae litterae,
quae sunt iu ‘optimus', postremam litteram detrahebant, nisr' vocalis
insequebatur. The tendency oi the language, however, was fixed, and
sfinal with other final consonants has entirely disappeared in Italian.
A. 375, a,· G. 7²2; H. 603, 1. n. 3. roo. genus: supply rerum.
The limiting genitive with genus is often omitted; ct. 2, 4473 3, 483.
The argument here is precisely that of Epicurus: ‘First indeed,
(we are to admit) that nothing is produced from the non-existent;
ior (it it could be) everything would be produced from everything3
oi seeds, at least, nothing would have need! See Diog. Laert. 10,
24, 38. 1⁶1. mare: the abl. ends regularly in r’,as &8903 mareis
occasionallytound in other writers. See Roby,‘ Gr.’4ap Neue gives
lull list oi examples, ‘Formenlehre’ 1. 229-230. 162 squami-
gerum: gen. pl.; cf.2, 1083 and n. on 1 droam. 'l'his word is first
met with in Cicero’s translation of the ‘Phaenomena' ot Aratus, 318
(574) exin squamigeri serpentes ludere pisces, whence the poet likely
drew it; ior he seems to have studied with admiration this youthful
worlr ot Cicero’s, andin many instances to have been indebted to it.
163. armenta: armenta and praedes are both tame animals as opposed
to genus scramm ; the lormer word refers to the larger sort, especially
ploughoxen and horses; the latter to the smaller, as the lesser cattle,
sheep, goats etc. See D'dderlein,‘1at.Synonyms.’ 164 tene·
rent: like posset above and the following subjunctives, a verb oi an
apodosis whose protasis is to be supplied from 1 sp rod ferre etc.=
ornnes arbores omnis fructus (ie. onrniasructuurn genera) ferre possent.
167. ubi: almost = si; so also cum is sometimes used to introduce
a conditional clause-genitalia corpora: see n. to 55 primordro.
168. qui: old abl. with the force ot an adv: ‘how could things have
afixed, unvarying mother?' 169. at nunc: ‘but as it is.’ At is
often used to introduce an objection to a preceding statement, some-
times correcting the false with the true as here, sometimes bringing
torward a conflicting statement that is to be met, as 803. where see n.
-seminibust Lucr. uses creare with de and abl, ex and abl, or
simple abl. Ct. 155, 646 17⁰· inde: with ubi = ex eo . . ,ἐκ
