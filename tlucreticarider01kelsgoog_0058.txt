lii INTRODUCTION

ln his collocation of words Lucretius sometimes shows a
striving aiter effect The fondness ior alliteration and asso-
nance, so common among the early latin writers, is displayed in
no small degree. Yet the ear does not sate with the results oi
it;·often his arrangements oi words, especially in the adaptation
oi verse-movement to sense, are peculiar and highly effective.
The versification ol Lucretius is a vast improvement upon that
of Ennius in regularityand caseos movement. There is a ten-
dency toward tte monotonous; but it is always a monotony
suggestive rather ol majestic flow thau insipid rippling. Its
rhythm is on the whole more pleasant to the ear than that of
Horace’s hexameters, though it lacks the subtle variety and
artistic tinish oi Vergil’s. As a philosopher Lucretius was
surpassed by no Roman in the power of grasping a system ol
thought, or in cogency oi reasoning; as a poet he was un·
equalled by any Roman in originality and power oi expression.
The De Rerum illatura is hy many regarded, not unjustly, as
the greatest didactic poem oi all literature.
