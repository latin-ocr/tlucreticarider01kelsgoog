fuel at fixed times.1 Thuuder is produced hythe collision oi
clouds, or by the bursting of clouds from peut-up wind, or the
blowing os the wind violently through them, or the conflict of
inharmonious elements in them. Flashes of lightning are seen
when the clouds for some reason have struck forth seeds os five.
· Thunderholts are iorged by the wind compressing the clouds,
and forcing the elements of heat into a fiery mass; this falls
with so great violence partly because oi the impulse given it by
the condensed cloud driving it forth, partly by reason of its own
weight and the exceeding fineness of the particles of which itis
’ composed.2 Water·spouts are made by the confinemeut of wind
in a cloud, when the power of the hlast‚ not being sufficient to
burst it, forces it down to the surface of sea or land.8 Volca-
noes are formed when the wind, imprisoned in vast earth-caverus‚
by its pressure melts portions ol rock, and forces forth the mol-
ten mass, together with much saud brought in its way hy under-
ground channels from the sea.4 The violence oi these winds,
and sometimes the falling in of the cavern touls, are causes of
earthquakes.⁵ The alternate warmth and cooluess in some
wells and hot springs may be explained hythe shifting os parti·
cles of heat srom earth to water, or from water to earth, with the
alternate contractiori and expausion oi the earth by day aud by
night or at different seasons.⁶ The power oi the magnet results
from this: that the atoms in it by their hlows continually force
the air away from it on every side3 into the vacuum thus pro·
duced rush all other bodies not tor some reason held back.l
Disease and pestileuce have their origin in the taintiug of the
air by elements banetul to life⁸ In this way purely natural
causes can be assigned ior everything that happens. If it were
not for the groundless lears that burden the souis of men there
would be uo need oi studying the processes os nature-⁹
