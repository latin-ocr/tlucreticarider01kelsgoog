LUCRETIUS AS A PHILOSOPHER xvii

A'great impulse was given to education, especially that part oi ,

it concerned with the training of the orator. With progressive
enlightenment the old religion lost its hold on the higher classes.
Something was needed to take its place as a guide to duty.
Shaking off the ,shackles of a confused and corrupting poly-
theism, the best minds oi Rome awoke to a tull realization oi
the mysteries oi existence, and sought a theory ol things in
which they could find rest. The Greek philosophy seemed to
meet all needs. To it the Romans turned, partly indeed as

fined to the higher classes. lt was only by the precepts and
the examples¹ of the lives os these that philosophy had influence
upon the masses.

In Lucretius' time all the principal Greek schools were repre·

the Stoic, the Peripatetic, the N ew Academic, and the Epicu·

to the Roman character, and had the greatest following. The
Peripatetic differed from the Stoic mainly in the position that
in comparison with virtue other things are entitled to considera·

the N ew Academy, accepting probability as the basis of their

speculation, were eclectio, and gleaned irom every source; gen·
