opima: the fertility oi Sicily was proverbial. It was famous for both
the fineness oi its stock and the variety oi its ituits By some it was
thought to be the native country oi wheat; and after the decline oi
Italian tarming it became one oi the principal sources oi the Roman
grain supply. 729. viro: Empedocles. 73¹· earmina: all the
writings oi Emped. that we know of were in verse. Fragments oi
only two poems are extant, the Περὶ Φύσεως, ‘On Nature‚' and the
Καθαρμοί, ‘Purifications’ The style was animated, remarkable ior

but Pyrru, with which dat is to be supplied -lauros sacred to
Apollo because oi its connection with Daphne, whom the god once
loved; as he pursued her, mother earth opened to receive the maid,
and then, to console him, produced the hay-trec. Ovid, however, in
the Metamorphoses represents Daphne as herself turned into* a laurel-
tree. Those who came to the temple at Delphi as suppliants wore
wreaths oi laurel. Before ascending the tripod the priestess burned
hay-leaves -on the altar3 and when seated she was surrounded by
wreaths oi thern, the smell of which, Munro remarks, was thought
“to increase the prophetie afflatus excited by the cold air which came
