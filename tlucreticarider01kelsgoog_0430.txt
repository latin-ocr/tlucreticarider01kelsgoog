by the Pythagoreans, Stoics, and many others, that the liie oi animals
is a part os the great universal liie,-a fragment, as it were, oi the
world-soul. The Epicureans were especially hostile to the belief that
matthas any spark oi the divine in him,-

eive hunc divino semine fecit
ille opifex rerum, mundi melioris origo,
eive recens tellus seductaque nuper ab alto
aethere, cognati retinebat semina caeli. (ον. Met. 1, 78-81.)

Ci.a,1154-5. 794. nec ter. etc: in opposition to the view of
Anaximander, that the first life was generated by the heat oi the sun
in the primal slime as the earth was becoming dry; and that “the
land animals, including man, had at first been fishes, and afterwards,
when they were able to develop themselves under their new shape,
they had come on shore and thrown off their scales.” See Zeller,
‘Prae-Soc. Phil! i. 255-6. The ianciiul theory oi the idealist, Oken,
is strikingly similar; see his ‘Physio-Philosophy,’ trans. by Tulle,
ἓ 900 et seq.: “Every organic has issued out of mucus; the primary
mucus, out oi which every organic has been created, is the sea·
mucus. The sea-mucus was originally generated through the influ-
ence of light. . . . Light shines upon the earthelement and it is salted.
Light shines upon the salted sea and it lives.” Diod. Sic. (3, 2)
says that the first men formed were the Ethiopians, because as the
moist earth dried off ‘it was natural that the spot nearest the sun
should be the first to produce animate natures’ (φύσεις ἐμψύχους).
795. maternum nomen: see nn. to 1, 250-1. Into the popular no·

804 lincunt: see n. to 3, 553.-sponte sua etc: throughout the
passage the implicationis that the living things spontaneously pro·
duced hythe earth came forth fully formed and adapted to the condi·
tions of existence. This is in opposition to the teaching oi Empedocles,
that the different parts of animals and men grew up separately out of
the earth, being at length united into beings through Love. Ci. n.
to 1, 716. Lucr. agrees with Empedocles, however, in supposing that
plants came into existence before animals. Diogenes oi Apollonia,
Parmenides and Democritus believed that animal liie was first pro·
