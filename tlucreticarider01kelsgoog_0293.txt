ing sphere Lucr. identified with the aether, in which, as the outer place,
the lighter, fiery elements oi the world gathered. See 5, 4 54-494 and
nn.; cf. also 2,1o6h By mundi here the poet probably means thc
world, not the universe (lor which mundus was osten used by the
Stolos, but never by the Epicureans) nor the heavens. The Epicu·
reans believed in an infinite number of worlds; see Lucr. 2, 1052
etseq. “Epicurus carried himself in thought beyond this visible uni·
verse, and well knew that there are innumerable other worlds besides
the one we inhabit, and that the heaven does not form the extreme
boundary of the whole nature oi things.'’ Dr. Mosheim’s note on
Cudworth’s ‘Intellectual System oi the Universe,' iii. 481. The Sto·
ies taught that the world and the universe are the same,- a compact
sphere, bounded by aether, outside ol which space extended on all
sides to infinity. See n. to 958. cf. Manilius 1,194 et seq.; Plin.

Infinite power can only be conceived oi as an attribute oi the Di·

everything is limited, finite; that there is no infinite power in any·
thing.

Dis. 1, 12, 26. The Epicurean doctrine, however, was based upon the
