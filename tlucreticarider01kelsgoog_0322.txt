failure to notice this distinction involved tlre ideas of most of tbe
ancients about tirne and space in utter confusion; and, in fact, it was
not till Kant that the subject was finally cleared up. ⁴⁶4 Tyn-

tory are accidents oi matter and void. The causes, characters, scenes,
and incidente of the Trojan War formed a body of stoclr illustrations,

it their origin as a people and the genealogies of leading families.

Ι 465. Troiiugenas: the spelling adopted by Lachmann and Munro

from the best ars, Α. The other usn. and edit. have the common
form Troiugena (Trffugena) given by the dictionaries. So 476
Troiianis, 477 Graiiugenarum-dicunt: ‘they say,' i.e., the Stoics,
who considered time as immaterial, yet gave “to the conception of
time a meaning as concrete as possible,” that time might have a real

shepherd on Mt. Ida, having shown great courage in protecting the
flocks and his companionS, received the name Alexander (infe-empne:
‘defending men'). By this name he is usually designated in the
Iliad. 475. clara: in this word Munro sees a play on the two mean-
ings of clames, ‘famous in story,’ and ‘bright‚’ in reference to the
flames of war. 476. clam: prep. with Troiianis ; rarcly used
with the abl.; see Roby, 1877. It may be that clam is an adv. and
Troii. a dat. oi disadvantage. - durateus: transferred from the Greek
bovpdreos ‘wooden,' and used only of the horse before Troy. Cf.
Hom. Od. 8, 493 and 51²· 477. equos: earlier spelling of equus:
