in ridding himself of the idea that he will somehow live, wholly or in
part, after death. 878. facit: see nto 1, (ryg-esse . . . su-
per:=superesse. 880. On the order of the words (coniunctio)
see n. to 1‚146.—in morte: = postmortem. 881. illim: i.e.,
from the body, or the lile of the body. 882. removet: supply se.-
illum: properly illud, but attracted to the masc. form by the relation

‘and stands by and impregnates it with his own sense! 885. alium
se: ‘other seli! 886. se: ‘his own self'3 so se in 887. 888.

the common mode of burial in the earth: though some have thought
that the poet had in mind the death of criminals by sinking them in a
