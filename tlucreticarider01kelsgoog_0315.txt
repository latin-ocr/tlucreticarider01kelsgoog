It is asserted that motion can take place without void by the displace.
mem of matter, lutfalsely ,¹ or without varii there could be uo mginning
ofmotion ( 370-38 3). Wro gtoo is the action that when two bodies start
apart, the air between st was previously there condensed ,· thc air
rushes in to fill the void, but could not itself condense unless there were
void ia it (384-397).

each proposition involves a contradiction; aut . . . aut is used
with propositions mutually exclusive. The Epicureans admitted the
reality ol motion and the existence oi void3 Melissus took the other
horn oi the dilemma and, denying the existence ot void, sought to show
therefrom the impossibility of motion. His reasoning is interesting.
“Every movement presupposes a void; that which can receive
another into itseli is void; that which cannot receive another is full 3
that which moves can do so only in the void. But the void would
be non-existent, and the non-existent does not exist. Consequently
there is no void, therefore no motion.” See Zeller‚ ‘Prae-Socratis
Philosophy‚’ i. 635. As regards the soundness ot the dilemma the

philosophers oi today are not much more able to pronounce with
certainty than in the time ot Epicurus, tor each oi the statements
must be treated as an induction3 and in the present limited range ot
scientific knowledge, when even the atoni oi which men speak with
so much positiveness rests on an hypothesis, certainty regarding them
is unattainable. 383. initum2=initium ; so also 2, 269 initum
