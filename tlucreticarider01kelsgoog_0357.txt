1. Praise of Epicurus. 1-3o

thou art my graeide, 0 glory of tde Grecian solt, thou that with god·
like reason basi revcaled the true nature os things, hart simon tte
blessed abodes of the deities far away from all regara' of men, and bart
caused tte rcalm os Acheron to vanhh. 1-30.

3. te: Epicurus. The followers oi Epicurus clung to his teach·
ings with almost superstitious devotion. His immediate pupils were
required to commit briei summaries oi them to memory‚ and the
practice appears to have been kept up as long as the school con·
tinued in existence. Such was the dogmatic impress which Epicurus
stamped upon his doctrines that they never underwent expansion,
never departed from his own utterances. In the servile dependence
upon a founder, the Epicureans can be compared only with the
Pythagoreans, who, it is said, had ior all kinds ot objections one and
the same answer, αὐτὸς ἔφη, ipse deicit. The Epicureans usually spoke
oi their master with unmeasured laudatiori, and did not hesitare to
call him divine. See n. to 1, 66. Cf. Cic. N. D. 1, 16, 433 Zeller,
‘Stoics, Ep, 3ηά Scep! ch. 16. 4. fieta: old participle oi figo:
fixa. 5. cupidus: the adj. supplies the place oi a causal clause,
coordinate with quod. . . aveo. 8. tortis: ‘spirited’ fort. eq. vis
is found also 764, 3ηά was perhaps suggested by Ennius’ line sic ut
fortis equs ete, in Cic. Cat. Maior 5, 14 (Vahlens' Enn. Ann. 441).
9. pater: simplya term oi respect, 3 common usage with the cor·
responding words in all languages. - rerum inventor: so Prot. Tyn-
dall finds in Charles Darwin “the Abraham ol scientific men.” See
Wainwright‚ ‘Scientific Sophisms,’ ch. 1, ior other instances oi iik‘
