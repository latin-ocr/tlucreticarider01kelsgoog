95⁸· Omne etot ‘the existing universe is bounded iu none ot its
dimensione) nul. reg. vi.: Munro well explains, ‘take which-
ever oi the roads through the universe you please, at no point in any
ol them will you reach its bound) Ci. Epicurus in Diog. Laert. 10,
24, 41-2: ‘And moreover the universe is inlinite3 for that which
is limited has an outside, and the outside is pereeived in relation to
something else. So that, not having an outside, it has no boundaryg
and, not having a boundary, it must be infinite and not limited! The
Stoics, following Aristotle,taught that the universe islimited, but that
outside oi it thereis unlimited extent oi void space. The question
whether or not the universe is finite was one that aroused sharp con-
troversy long aiter Lucretius' day. Cf. Lucian ‘Ikaromenippum 8 eal
γὰρ circulatim νεανικὴ αὐτοῖς ἦ μᾶχη, τοῖς μὲν τέλει eh τᾶν περιγρά-
φουσι, τοῖς di ἀτελὲς τοῦτο εἶναι ὑπολαμβάνουσιν. For the view of
3 modern materialist, ef. Haeckel, ‘Nat Hlst. oi Creation,’ ch. 13
(i. p. 324) z “The universe is unlimited and immensurable in both space
and time. Nor can we imagine a beginning or end to the uninter-
rupted and eternal motion in which all particles of the universe are
always engaged. . . . The great lans oi the conservatian ‹ffsorce and
the conservation ef matter, the foundations oi our whole conception
oi motion, admit oi no other supposition. The universe, so lar as it “
is cognizable to human capability, appears as a connected chain of
material phenomena of motion, necessitating a continual change ot
forms. Every torm, as the temporary result oi a multiplicity of phe
nomena oi motion, is as such perishable and of limited duration. But,
in the continual change oi lomus, matter and the motion inseparable
from it remain eternal and indestructible.” cf. nn. on 150 and 1021.
