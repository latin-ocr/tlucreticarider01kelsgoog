of place. ct. 1, 221 quod nunc. 84 Triviai virginis: Diana (or
Hecate), whom the Romans completely identified with the Greek Arte·
mis. She was called Trivia virgo or simply Trivia, because wor-
shipped and invoked at places where three ways met. Cf. Verg. Aen.

Iphigenia, the daughter of Agamemnon and Clytemnestra. When the
Grecian fleet was gathered at Aulis in Boeotia for the expedition against
Troy and detained by storms, Chalcas being summoned declared that
Agamemnon had given offence to Diana, and that this could be
atoned for only by the sacrifice of his daughter Iphigenia to the
goddess. Thereupon, under pretence of marriage to Achilles, the
maid was brought to Aulis ; but just as she was about to be offered
up Diana bore her on high to Tauris, where she became a priestess in
the temple. This is the common form of the legend; but Lucr, to
add force to his argument, assumes that she was really sacrificed as a
victim. The story of iphigenia was a favorite theme ol the classic
writers. It formed the basis of a master tragedy by Euripides,
and in modern times has been splendidly handled by Racine in his
‘Iphigenie en Aulide: and by Goethe in the ‘Iphigenie auf Tauris!
86. prima virorum: = ro πρῶτα τῶν ἀνδρῶν. The use of the parti-
tive gen. alter the neuter pl. of an adj. is very common in Lucr.‚ tak-

together strands of red and white wool; these were tied into a band
os wool (vr'tta) that encircled the head, and were allowed to hang
down. The sacrifice is here described as in the Roman fashion3 for
