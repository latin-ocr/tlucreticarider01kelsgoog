Munro compares 0 striking illustration oi Locke, ‘Essay on the
Human Understanding,’ 2, 13, 21: “1 would ask whether, it God
placed ,0 man at the extremity oi corporeal beings he could not
stretch his hand beyond his body? It he could, then he would put
his arm where there was belore space without body; and it there he
spread his fingere, there would still be space between them without
body. It he would not stretch out his hand, it must be because oi
some external hindrance. . . . Iwould lain meet with that thinking
man that can 10 his thoughts set any bouuds to space.'’
