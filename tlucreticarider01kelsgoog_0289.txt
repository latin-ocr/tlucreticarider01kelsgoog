41-43. Various conjectures have been made regarding the time to
which these lines 10101. That 01 Munro is the most likely to be
correct; he thinks “that Lucr. was writing these lines towards the
close 01 695, 01 four years before his death, when Caesar was consul,
and had formed his coalition with Pompey. Memmius was then
praetor designatus, in fierce opposition to Caesar, and at that time
on the side 01 the Senate with Cicero, and doubtless Lucretius.

Isaac Vossius was the first to notice that they were inserted here to
show the inconsistency 01 the poet i'n addressing a divinity at the
