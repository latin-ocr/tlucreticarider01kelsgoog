shincs with its own light, the complete or partial withdrawal of its
brightness at times may beaccounted ior in two ways: either a dark
body in a regular course through the heavens partly or entirely hides
it irum us (717-9); or it may be bright only on one side, and, being
spherical, in the course ot its revolutions may present to us first the
light and then the dark side, with varying phases (720-730). 720.

728. astrologorum: not ‘astrologers' but ‘ astronomers‘ though both
significations arc met with in classical writers. The reference is to
those who held that the moon's light is derived from the sun, as most
oi the Greeks who did not personify the sun and moon taught.
This view is said to have been first set forth by Anaximenes (see Zel-
ler, ‘Prae-Soc. Phil.' i. 275 tor rei. to original authorities); the
Pythagoreans, however, believed that the moon, like the sun, isa
glassy sphere‚ which reflecte light and heat back to the earth from the
centra] fire; Anaxagoras and Democritus agreed that both sun and
moon are bodies of earthy nature, heated by the motion oi the sky3
and Xenophanes said that the moon burne out and is kindled airesh.
This last view has been attributed to Heraclitus also, but on insuffi-
