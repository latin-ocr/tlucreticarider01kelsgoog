in piacet then a third aireurrent causes the revolution oi the
heavens by blowing either over the sphere or under3 in the last case
the motion is produced just as the current oi a stream turns a
water-wheel— aera: the air-current holds a most important place in
the explanation oi phenomena both celestia] and terrestrial by the
ancients. It was employed by Anaximander to explain the move·
ment oi the heavenly bodies; by Anaximenes, to account ior the circu·
lar form of their orbits3 by Empedocles, to show the reason for the
inclination ol the earth’s axis toward the path oi the sun; by Arche·
laus (follower oi Anaxagoras) and others to account ior the steady
position oi the earth in the world; by Democritus, Metrodorus, and
the Epicureans, to explain the cause oi earthquakes (cf. 6, 535-607).
Cf. also the Stoic doctrine that “ all attributes by means of which one
object is distinguished irem another are produced by the existence
oi certain air-currente, which emanate from the centre oi an object,
diffuse themselvesto its outer limits, and having reached the suriace,
return again to the ceutre to constitute the inward unity3 ” by some,
moreover, air-currents were given no small significance in the expla-
nation oi the soul. In many cases it seems as it the ancient philos·
ophers, when they had come across a great mystery and wished to
heed the dictum expressed in Horace’s nec deus interut, took refuge
in an air-current, instead ol a god, as unseen cause. 514 aeterni:

give this form, which is generally taken as awrong reading or an
equivalent of immamu. It is better explained, however, as derived
from Summanus, the name oi an ancient divinity who was thought
to preside over the nocturnal sky arrd to wield the lightnings that'
appear in the night3 there was a temple ior his worship near the
Circus Maximus, and in the pediment of the temple ol the Capitoline
Jupiter there was a representation of him. Summunia templa, theu,
as Munro interprets, relers¹ to the nightly sky3 trans. ‘heaven’s Sum·

language, which strictly interpreted would be inconsistent with his
system. The thought is, that the heavenly bodies, gathering to them·

adapted to them are found in greatest abuudance3 ior to different
