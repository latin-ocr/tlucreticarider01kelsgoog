and put into usage by authority, that relations might be loss ambigo
ous and speech more concise. The wise, too, bringing into experienoe

ing reason employed them in the same sense.’ Most writers on the
origin 01 Language agree with Lucr. in putting it aiter the first steps
01 progress. Cf. Haeckel, ‘Nat Hist. 01 Creation,' ii. 300: “'Ihe

uses the same illustration for the same purpose as Lucr.; ‘Descent
