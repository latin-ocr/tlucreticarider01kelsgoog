cf. ‘Morale d'lipicure et ses rapports avec les doctrines contempo-
raines,' p. 159: ·‘Witlrout doubt already there have been found in
Lucretius a large number oi modern ideas, as those of evolution and
oi natural selection; but that oi human progress, moral, intellectual,
and industrial progress, which he has so clearly expressed, has up to
the present hardly been noticed. Still, the fifth book oi Lucretius has
the most striking analogy with the ⁴⁶ Esqulsse des progrds de l’esprit
hunrain,” drawn in our day hy Condorcet.' 336. cum primis:

Zeller from Cic. Tusc. Disp. 4, 3, 6 fixes his date “not long after the

count οἱ their style that Lucr. passes over in contempt the services oi
Amafinius and Rabirius (or Rabinus) in popularizing the Epicurean
philosophy3 at any rate, their books were much read, as is evident
from Cic. Tusc, Disp. 4, 3, 6 cuius (Amafinirl libris editos commoto mul-
