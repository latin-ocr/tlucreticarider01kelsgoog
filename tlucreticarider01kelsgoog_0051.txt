LUCRETIUS As Α PHILOSOPHER xlv

in atone oi perfect assurance he gives expression to mere
guesses, mentioning several possible causes oi anything when·
ever he can. His principal concern is always to show how
matters move on without divine power. Yet in several instances
he hits upon theories that are generally thought to be dis·
tinctively modern.

Life, ancient atomism taught, originated of itselr' from certain
combinations of atoms. In regard to this, again, modern atom-
ists are divided. The theistic believe that above and behind
the chemical equilibrium ol the organism there is an elusive
something which presides over it, which can have an origin in
no possible combination oi matter acted upon by force alone,
which can come only from some higher power. But the mate·
rialists hold, with Lucretius, that lite is spontaneously produced
in matter under certain conditione. There is, however, this dil·
ierence. Lucretius assumed that all the present types oi living
things, with many others that have died out, came into being
and sprang directly from crass matter when the earth was new,
and have not changed. He believed in the simultaneous origin
and invariability ol species. Scientific investigation now points
to a common physica} basis oi rire in protoplasm. The advo-
eates oi evolution, observing in the scale oi being a gradual
ascent irorn the lowest to the highest forms, hold that the low-

· est came into existence first3 and that the higher have been

developed from the lower by gradual and progressive differen-
tiation, either in unbroken succession from the simplest organic
existence up to man, or with special creations at certain points.
The theistic evolutionist finds the origin oi protoplasm in the
creative act oi God, and sees in the development oi iorms, either
with or without special creations atcertain points, the unlolding
oi a divine plan: the atheistic and the agnostic eliminate srom
the process everything except matter, force, and time3 make

protoplasm a spontaneous product‚ and the ascending scale ol
being an undirected accident within the limitation of certain

natural laws, 'the existence and operation ol which are not
accounted lor. Lucretius makes no attempt to bridge over the
