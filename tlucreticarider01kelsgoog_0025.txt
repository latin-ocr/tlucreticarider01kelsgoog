LUCRETIUS As A PHILOSOPHER xix

strate was water3 Anaximenes, air3 Anaximander, an infinite,
indefinite substance. The Pythagoreans grasped at the idea ot
the essential difference between spirit and matter, but yet were
not able in their thinking to purge matter of psychical qualities3
hence their doctrine ol the world-souk The Eleatics recognized
more clearly than they the antagonism between matter and
spirit, but relegated the former to the domain of pure phenom·
ena, denying the reality ol change and making being and
thought identical3 to them the universe was one vast, change-
less thought. Heraclitus1 assumed lire as the fundamental
matter, and attributed to it psychical properties, taking it as both
cause and symbolos change, the reality ol which he maintained
in opposition to the Eleatic doctrine. The Atomists rank with
Empedocles² and Anaxagoras⁸ as the first who made complete
severance of the physical and the psychical, -matter and mov-
ing cause; aud who, in order to explain changes and the on·going
of the universe, assumed the operation of some principle entirely
butside of matter and above it. Empedocles taught that there
are four ultimate forms of matter, or elements; and two influ-
ences, or directing forces,4 acting upon them. Anaxagoras as·
sumed an indefinite number of primitive substances, infinitely
divisible, and a rational force as final cause. Midway between
the two came the Atomists, who made an advance upon Empe·
docles in positinga single ultimate matter, made up of indivisible
particles, the different shapes of which explained the possibility
ol all combinations3 but they adopted a less philosophie con·
ception oi moving cause than Anaxagoras,- appealing to the
inadequate law ol necessity.

The Atomists were two, Leucippus and Democritus. Of the
former little is known save that he furnished the basis of the .
theory ol the latter. Democritus⁶ was born about 460 u. c. Ac·
cording to him there is matter, or the “fulb” and there is
“void'‘ or space devoid ol matter. The latter must be consid·
