5, 1161-1243 and nn3 2, 54 etc Burton’s discussion oi religioos mel·
ancholy, ‘Anat oi Melan' Part 3‚sec. 4, contains many quaint and
suggestive observations on the iears inspired by religion or the lack oi
it. ⁶2. ante oculos: aforcible expression in emphatic position3
tr. ‘in plain sight? 65. super: adv„ as in 39, ‘overhead,' ‘above’
The poet seems to have seen in imagination some vast lowering pres·
enee like the cloud-forms so graphically described in 4,129-142.
⁶6. Graius homo: Epicurus. For his philosophy see Introd; on the
extravagant praise bestowed on him by his followers, see n on 3, 3
te.-mortalis with oculos-contra: adv„ in sense = contra illaria.
In Lucr. contra, arete, past, super, supera (supra), and subm are oitener
adverbs than prepositions. Cimini, extra, inter, praeter, propter are
also frequently adverbs. Holtze‚ ‘Syntaxis Lucretianae Lineamenta,’
cap. 4, gives abundant illustrations oi the different uses. 68. tama:
Bentley, whom Lachmann lollows, reads fimo instead ossama ; be·
cause, as Lachmann says, sct'lr'cet sama nan amna's massaria magna
est. Fama not only has the 'authority of the mss, but also gives
better sense; ior it was not so much the existence of gods or
shrines of the gods as the untounded story of them, that inspired

70. inritat: inritat for inritavit5 so 6, 587 disturbat ior disturbavit.
See Roby, ‘Gn’ 662. The contracted perfect in the third pers.
sing. and first pers. pl. ot the indic is rare; ior examples see Neue,
‘Formenlehre’ 2d edit. ii. 534 Cases like inritat must be careiully
distinguished from versdt (Enn. Ann. quae . . . versdt in pectore fixa,
Cic. De Sen. r, 13 Vahlen's Enn. 346) and the like, where the original
doi conj. 1 is retained in the present tense. Instances ot the latter
use are not uncommon in Plautus, and are occasionally met with in
the poets oi the Augustali Age. See Corssen, ‘Aussprache,’ 2d edit.
ii. 488; also Neue, ut sup. ii. 433-4 72 viv. vis am: a striking
expression, especially for one who considered mind and soul only a
form oi matter. 73. processit: supply illc, referring to Epicu·
rus ; so peragravit below-moenia mundi: the tire-belt, or aether,
that many oi the ancients thought lormed the outer enveloping por·
tion of the world Epicurus did not assign to this definitely the
nature oi fire; in his letter to Pythocles (Diog. Laert. 10, 2 5, 88) he
says that the world is a kind of extent girt by the heaven, embracing
both stars and earth and all things visible; that it is separated from
the infinite, and is confined within a limit, in texture either rare or
