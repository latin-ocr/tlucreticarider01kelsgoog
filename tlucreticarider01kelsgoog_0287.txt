ceos was the subject oi man} Greek works, in both prose and verse,

from the time oi Anaximander down. lt stood as title probably to
the philosophie poem oi Xenophanes, certainly to that oi Parmeni-
des, and the most important one oi Empedocles. Empedocles' πφδ
φύσεως both iurnished a model and gave inspiration to our poet, who
in several places shows traces oi its influence. See 1, 716 et seq,
and nn. Epicurus also leit a treatise in thirty-seven books having
the same title. See Diog. Laert. ro, 17, ²7· Fragments oi it are
extant in the work oi Philodemus, deciphered irem the charred rolls
discovered at Herculaneum. Moreover, prior to Lueretius, Amafinius
set forth in barbarous Latin the physical doctrines oi Epicurus,
though under what title or titles is not known. On the whole, then,
the title de rerum natura being in harmony with the subjeets chosen
ior their works by his philosophie predecessors, probably suggested
itseli to our poet as the one best suited to his theme ς arrd thus was
not, as it has been asserted, taken direetly from Epicurus' περὶ φύ-
oeo2.-pangere: first applied to the writing oi poetry perhaps by
Ennius. See the famous epigram on himself given in Cic. Tusc. Disp.

26. Memmiadae: like Sepiada (3, 1034), a word of irregular for·
motion, having a Greek patronymie termination added to a Latin
stem. Gaius Memmius, to whom Lueretius dedicates his poem, and
oi whom he speaks irr' terms oi the sincerest regard, was a preminent
figure in the polities oi the time. The Memmian gens was oi ple·
beian origin, and oi little note till the Jugurthine war. About that time
Gaius Memmius, the grandfather oi Lucretius’ friend, made himself
famous by strenuous and unyielding opposition to the aristocratic
party. He exposed its corruptions, impeached several oi its lead·
ing men, and finally as candidate ior the consulship meta violent
death at the hands oi a urob led by Saturninus-the incident re·
terred to by Cic. in Cat. 4, 2. After this the name is often met with in
Roman annals till the close oi the Republic. The Memmius referred
to here was a man oi power, but utterly lacking in principle. The
date oi his birth is not known3 but he was plebeian tribune in 66, and
won distinction by opposition to the triumph demanded by Lucullus
retrrrning victorious from the war with Mithridates, on the ground that
the booty had been wrongiully turned to private gain and the war
uuneeessarily prolonged The charges were so well sustained that
