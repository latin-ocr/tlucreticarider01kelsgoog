mal slime‚’'as Zeller calls it. St. Augustine accounted for the apparent
spontaneous generation of minute living things by declaring that at
the beginning oi the world, when God created man and the other ani·
mals, he made also an infinite number ot invisible seeds‚ which are
present in all the elements and develop into life under the right
conditions of heat and moisture. 805. tibi: see ιι. to 1, 675-

The modern advocates ol materialistic evolution have found it diffi-
cult to explain why at the beginning the lowest forms of life were
spontaneously produced from the earth and today similar forms are
not still produced (tor there is not a particle of evidence to show that
spontaneous generation is going on at present) ς and why those lowest
forms have not all worked up toa higher plane ot existence, instead
oi showing no essentia] change oi type in the vast periods oi time
that have elapsed since remains oi life began to be fossilized in the
rocks. To the first question no one has offered a solution more satis-
factory than that proposed by our poet in these two lines. 800
