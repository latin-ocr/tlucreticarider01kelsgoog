LUCRETIUS As A PHILOSOPHER xliii

Even Boyle thought that the atoms cohere by reason oi their
jagged shapes. The three agreed, however, in looking to the
power oi God as final cause in the building up oi things out oi
atoms. With the discovery oi the law of gravitation the course
of physical speculation was changed. Gradually the doctrine
of attraction and repulsion‚ the conception oi forces acting im-
mediately in the relations of atoms one with another, was intro-
duced. The new principle seemed so potent and wide-reaching
in its application, that an all-moving spirit hardly seemed neces·
sary in accounting ior the on·going oi the universe. A tendency
to the mechanical explanation ol nature became manifest. ln
accordance with the spirit oi this, Locke formulated his doctrine
of sensationalism, which so harmonized with the trend of the
times that it was most widely adopted as embodying the true
theory oi knowledge. The uniolding and application ol its doc·
trines revolutionized European speculatioo, leading directly to
the F rerich “ illumination,” with the rise ot a materialistic theory
ot the universe and a utilitarian theory ol morals. At present,
the mechanical explanation oi nature under the form of the
evolution hypothesis is again struggling lor the mastery.

The atom oi modern science is the atom of Lucretius without
the power of swerving. But Lucretius ha'd no proper concep·
tion of force. Here at once his physical theory breaks down.
For the doctrine of attraction he had only the poor substitute ol
varied shapes of atoms to keep them in combination. Repulsion,
indeed, he foreshadowed in the importance he attached to the
rebounding of atoms and masses aiter impact: but without the
assumption oi force this rebounding is inconceivable, because
the atoms are considered absolutely hard, and hence must be
inelastic. For the inherent downward tendency of atoms, mod·
ern science substitutes vibratory motion; it agrees with Lucre-
tius in supposing the movements of atoms to be inconceivably
swiit, lt agrees with him also in believing that all the processes
oi nature take place in accordance with certain laws of universal
sway and invariable action. For atinal cause the theistic physi-
cist looks to an allintelligent, all-potent God, who gave to atoms
