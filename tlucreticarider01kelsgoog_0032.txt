Lucretius followed Epicurus as unerring guide.¹ In his poem,
however, he did not attempt to expound the whole Epicu·
rean philosophy. Having in viewa definite aim,² he set forth
only those portions oi Epicurus’ teachings necessary to the
attainment oi it He treats in detail only the views on nature,
striving by his theory oi the universe and the development ot
civilization8 to banish all sear oi the gods, and by his prooi oi
the mortality of the soul to dispel the dread oi death. Inter-
spersed with his physical doctrines, however, there are many
ethical reflections⁴ that give an insight into his views oi life and
duty. li the lost work oi Epicurus ‘On Nature ’⁶ were extant,
doubtless Lucretius' poem throughout would be found to bear a
close resemblance to it. Whatever the poet teaches maybe
accepted as also the doctrine oi his master; only when carried
away with poetic inspiration does he step out of the beaten
track of the school to which he belonged.⁸ Lucretius' exposi-
tion may be conveniently treated under tour heads, -theory oi
