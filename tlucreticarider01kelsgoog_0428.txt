expression must refer to the cone-line shadow cast by the earth,
through which the moon posses, menstrua agrees with the subject of
perlabitur, referring to luna. But where does Lucr. get his cone-like
shadow? He conceives of the earth as flat; in this passage, then,
he must stand convicted of a bold inconsistency, having adopted
an astronomical notion that does not harmoniae with his system.
765-7. Correspond to 717-9. If this dark body comes below the
moon it shuts the moon¹s light off from the earth; if it passes above
the sun’s orb, it cuts the sun’s light off from the moon, making it
invisible. 76& et tamen: see n. to 1, ¹050· 768-770 cor·

Laert. 10, 96 ⁴ Eclipses of the sun and moon may be caused by their
being extinguished, just as we see happening in regard to things on
earth, or from the interposition of other bodies, the earth or the sky
or something of the kind. Thus we must set side by side the differ·
eut ways in whicb phenomena may take place, and bear in mind that
it is not impossible for several causes to concur. Now in the twelfth
book on Nature Epicurus says these things, and says further that the
sun suffers ‘eclipse when it passes into the shadow of the moon ; the
moon, when the shadow of the earth falls upon it, both sun and moon
quickly withdrawing from the shade) The error of Lucr. then (n. to
764) was that of his master also. From the same passage we leam
that it was shared by Diogenes the Epicurean 770· per: with
