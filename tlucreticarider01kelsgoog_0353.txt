rest of the universe built around it; and insisted on the unity and

ol means to end—quod: supply id. ¹054 mun. nat. =

samad-sursum: i.e., {rom the lower side up toward the common
contre. The Epicureans did not realize that in space there can be no
up and down. But this error was not by any means universal in anti-
qnity, as is sometimes supposed. Cf. Plato, ‘Timaeus ’ 62, c.: ‘lt is
quite erroneous to suppose that there are two opposite regions in the
universe, one above and the other below, and that heavy things natu·
rally tend to the latter place. The heavens are spherical, and every·
thing tends to the centre; and thus above and below have no
real meaning. It there bea solid globe in the middle, and it a per·
son walk around lt, he will become the antipodes to himself, and
the direction which is up at one time will be down at another!

antipodes is assigned by Diog. Laert. (8, 26) to Pythagoras, but the
same writer elsewhere says (3, 24) that Plato was the first to use the
word. Cf. Verg. Georg. 1, 247 et seq. ,· Plin. N. Η. 2, 653 Strabo, 15.
“The existence oi antipodes was, of course, bound up with the doc-
trine that the universe or the world is a globe (held by Plato and the
Stoics); hence the early Christian writers attaclr the two ideas
together as unscriptural.'’ Lactantius, Inst. 3, 23 Quid illi, qui esse con·
trarios vestiyitr nostris antapodes putant? num aliquid loquuntur? aut
est quisquam tam ineptus, qui credat esse homines, quorum vestrgrb sint
superiora quam capita? etc. St. Augustine (De Civ. Dei 16, 9) is
equally severe. As late as 1616, in the pontificate of Paul V.,a de·
cree ol the Catholic Church ordered that all books teaching the mo-
bllity of the earth and the immobility of the sun (a doctrine essentially
connected with the preceding) should be ‘suspended forbidden, and
condemned! Consult Whewe11‚ret.in n. to 10583 Reid's n. to Acad.
