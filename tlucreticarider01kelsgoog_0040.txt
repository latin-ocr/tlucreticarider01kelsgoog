Crait or courage or speed oi ssight or useiulness to man has pre·
served those animals that remain. All the rest, unable to meet

the conditions oi existence, have been swept off by ruthless
destruction.1 In men and brutes aliie, moreover, there is a
fixed law oi descent. The offspring repeat the characteristics
ol the parents in both body and temper.a Thus among the
living things, as well as in the realm oi the inorganic, natural
law is supreme.

4. Lucretius’ View of Man.

In man, as in all things else, there is nothing but matter aod
void. The human organism comprises three distinct parts, the
body, the soul or lise-principle, and the mind. These originem,
develop, decline, and perish together, for the mind and soul are
inseparably united with each other and with the body.8 The
mind is situated in the mid-region oi the breast‚ while the soul

is distributed throughout the form3 but the mind and soul are
so closely connected that they may be considered as one nature.
They are composed of the finest round atoms,-not of simple
elements, however, but of four separate combinations oi atoms
mingled together, wind, heat, air, and a subtle, nameless some-
thing that makes the iourth.⁴ Volitional impulse arises in this
last element, which imparts motion to the beat-portiom that in
turn to the wind, the wind to the air-essence3 thence move·
ment is aroused in the organism. The mind and soul of man
differ very little from those of animals. Lucretius does not
directly assert that the mind is the noblest part, but this was
clearly his opinion. Once at least he identifies personality
with it.⁶

Notwithstanding his material nature, man i's not an automaton.
