can be found.¹ The processes ol generalization from the pro·
ducts ol sense-perception and the formation ol judgments the
poet does not touch upon. Thus in common with his school, he
assumed immediate knowledge ol things, and found the only
source os knowledge in experience.

2. Lucretius’ Theory ol the Universe.

There are two elemental parts of the universe, matter and
void. All things are made up ol these. Void is everywhere
where matter is not; matter and void are mutually exclusive.²
Matter is composed of atoms. These are perlectly solid, with·
out beginning or end or any possibility ol change in nature,
minute beyond the limit ol vision, and known only by the mind.⁸
The atoms differ in lorm3 they are rough, smooth‚ hooked‚ ,
round,¹ longer, 'smaller3 but the various shapes are limited in
number, though there is an infinite number of atoms ol each
shape. They differ also in weight. The movement of atoms is
immeasurably swilt, and always downward, because ol their
gravity‚ unless impeded. Everything that exists contains void
as well as atoms, since only these are devoid of empty space.⁴
Color, heat, cold, moisture‚ dryness, all the properties that can be
detected in things, are accidents of the combinations of atoms3 the
atoms themselves have no properties save extension‚ hardness‚
weight‚ and motion. All combinations are unstable, continually
changing. Dissolution awaits everything.⁶

The universe is without limit in any ol its dimensions, and,
has no centre. There is no 'end to space, and atoms are num-
berless. There is an infinite number ol worlds.⁸ As the atoms
sall in infinite space. some by their own power swerve to one
side.⁷ These become involved with others, forming a whirling
