their form, to iorce its impulse oi movement3 who impressed
upon both matter and force 3 natural law, in accordance with
which the universe has been' built up and is carried on, in the
out-working oia comprehensive divine plan. But the atheistic
and agnostic thinkers‚ with the same inconsistency that charac-
terized Lucretius, starting with chance and without a lawgiver,
assume the reign oi law, and suppose that with this atoms and
space and iorce and time are adequate to account ior all the
facts and phenomena oi the present order ot things. The doc·
trine of the atom is just as consistent with a theistic as with 33
atheistic theory 01 the universe. Lucretius indeed personified,
deified nature. 13 this he is followed by some modern mate·
rialists‚ while others seem to put evolution in the place of God,
and deity a process.¹ ln assuming the eternity oi matter and
the continuity oi motion, the infinity citime and space, and
numberless atoms, as essential conditions to the coming of 3
world into existence, Lucretius and the modern materialist are
atone.

Regarding the genesis oi things, Lucretius loreshadows mod-
ern science in the nebular hypothesis. In his account 01 the
beginning of the world, as in the modern doctrine, we have
the chaotic mingling oi clashing and discordant elements; the
formation of a world·nucleus; the gradual differentiation oi parts
composed 01 matter in states oi unequal density. Here, how-
ever, the parallel ends. For the poet was giving range to his
imagination in a magnificent conception, adapted to his philoso-
phy irom the old mythology, while the nebular hypothesis is
based upon a careful examination oi the properties and relations
of the socalled elementary substances, iramed in accordante
with the laws oi force, and through experiment receives at least
a partial verification by analogy. 13 his ideas about the heavenly
bodies and his explanations oi natural phenomena, moreover,
Lucretius is almost everywhere adriit.² With alreen interest in
what is now termed science, but with no true scientific method,
