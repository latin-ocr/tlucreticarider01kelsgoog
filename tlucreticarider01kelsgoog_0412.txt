3, 592 et seq. to show that the soul perishes with the body; cf. espe-
cially 346-7 with 3, 602. 345. periclis: Epicurus held that all
the innumerable worlds would be destroyed, some in one way, some
in another. Cl. Diog. Lien ιο, 73 ‘All (the worlds) must be again
dissolved, some more rapidly. some more slowly, and some from
one cause, some lrom another! Cf. Plut Plac. 2,4. 35o atquee

remarks, “you would expect ullus l οι quisquam), just as in 359 nulla

universe is imperishable‚ but the world is not. 367. ex infiniroz
refers to space; cf. n. to ι, 1001. Epicurus taught that the space
between the worlds (μεταξὺ κόσμον olimpii, or perceleriter) was
not absolutely void, but contained more οι less stray matter. See
Diog, Laert. ιο, 89. How his gods managed to pass an undisturbed

and ever·blessed existence there, it is hard ιο imagine. 373. leti
