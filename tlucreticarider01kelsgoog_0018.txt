xii INTRODUCTION

But while Lucretius had no biographer and did not, like
Horace and Ovid, tell his lile out in his verse, his personality is
by no means obscure. No poem, ancient or modern, shows
more clearly than the De Rerum Natura the impress oi a marked
individuality. Some poets voice a general feeling, or paint a
pleasing fancy, or describe an experience, in such a way one
cannot tell whether they are giving an insight into their own
hearts and lives or not. But not so Lucretius. In the course
oi his reasoning he speaks in the first person, often with direct
address bids Memmius heed what he is saying.¹ His diction is
characterized by a vehemence and straightiorwardness oi state-
ment that can have their source only in sincerity and firm con·
viction. He never trilles Whether he is reasoning about the
atom, or explaining natural phenomena, or hurling fierce invec-
tives against the blind thraldom of men under superstition, he is
always terribly in earnest. Between the lines ol the poem we
read the man.

ln Lucretius the lire and graphic power of the poet were
aptly blended with the calm logic and constructive ability ol the
philosopher. With the poet’s eye he looked out upon the world,
and scanned the life oi men3 with philosophie sweep ol thought
he marshalled in array all the facts that he had gained, and tried
to track out causes, to know the origin and modes oi being, to
fathom the mystery oi the universe.² Few of the ancients lived
in so close sympathy with nature as he;⁸ yet he loved not
nature ior her own sake. He had what Tyndall c'alls the
‘⁶ scientific imagination.’'4 The perception of beauties oi land-
scape or of the sea and the discovery oi natural processes unno-
ticed by the common throng awoke indeed a responsive chord3
but all these forthwith were made to serve in the illustrating or
eniorcing of some truth, took their place in his philosophie sys-
tem. In the presence oi the problem oi the universe he had
