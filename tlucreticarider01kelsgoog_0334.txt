270 LUCRETIUS [1. 692-

a, 236 The original quantity oi the e was doubtless longa but in the
later poets it is generally short Ci. n. on 3, 918 νᾶ.

Tiar all things are offirc combats tlte madente os the censes, which is
to be accepted as final 690-704.

692. hic idem: i.e., Heraclitus-perdelirum. The Stoics and
the Epicureans, but particularly the latter, were famous ior abuse of
opponents and their views= see Cic N. D. t, ἓξ 93-4 In this respect
Lucr. stands in marked contrast to most oi his school, ior he gen·
erally speaks oi those whom he is reiuting with moderatiori and
courtesy. Philosophers oi today, however, should not be hasty in
criticising the narrow spirit oi ancient thinkers. Biichner (preface
to ‘Krait und Stoli’l alludes to his opponente as ‘yelping curs,‘
‘mental slaves,’ ‘a howling pack’; and even Tyndall, generally so
iairnrinded, speaks oi ‘brawler' and ‘clown' Cf. Wainwright ‘Sci-
entiiic Sophisms,' ch. 1 ; Elam, ‘Winds oi Doctrine,’ p. 132. ⁶93·
abr ‘from the side oi,’ i.e., 'on the side ol ’ς see Roby, 1813. To be
consistent with his doctrine oi perpetual change, Heraclitus had to
discredit the evidence oi the senses, which show us many things
apparently firm and changeless. See Zeller, ‘PraoSoe Phil’ ii. 88.
⁶⁹5· ignem: attracted to the acc. from its proper constr. as nom. to
cogn. est-ipsi: Heraclito. ⁶9⁶7· Fire he thought to be “the
only sensible phenomenon in which the substance oi things displays
itseli, according to its true nature.” 699-700. That the senses
never deceive was a cardinal tenet oi the Epicurean theory oi knowl-
edge, see 4, 378-521 and lntrod. Thorough-going materialists in all
ages, while boasting of the certainty oi their systems as founded upon
the evidence oi the senses, have been prone to iorget that the atom,
which lies at the foundation, is entirely beyond the ken oi sense3 and
thus the whole superstructure ot asserted truth remains but a hypoth-
esis incapable oi verification. They should be last, therefore, to criti·
cise those who build on something independent oi the senses or even
opposed to them. Ct.483-502; 599etreq. γοα quiz indecl. abl.
here=quo, having as antecedent quid. This form is iound also in
quicum, and may be used oi either number and all three genders.
From it carne qui-n, qui-pe (quippe) and the like. 703. neget:
subj. oi result; with quam the ut is often omitted. A. 332, b. ,· H.

502, 2. Ample illustration oi the usage is given by Draeger, ‘Hist
Syntax der Lat. Sprache,' ii. § 520, 2.
