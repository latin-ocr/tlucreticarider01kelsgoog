LUCRETIUS AS Α PHILOSOPHER xxv

his hands both uuderwent expansion, and were somewhat modi·
fied. He saw that if atoms are assumed to be of an infinite
number oi shapes, some may be infinitely large, which would be
inconsistent with the beliei that the atoms are invisible. He
held, therefore, that the shepes ol atoms are finite iu number,
but that the atoms ol each iorm are numberless. Observing,
moreover, thatin a vacuum all bodies must fall equally fast
in parallel lines, he rejected the teachiug that in the void the
heavier atoms falling strike the lighter3 he supposed that the
smaller atoms swerve a little lrom a straight downward course,
and that thus by mutual entanglement a world nucleus is formed.¹
The cause ol the swerving to one side he assigned not to the
operation ol the law ol necessity, but to a sort of iuberent
power, an originative impulse oi motion in the atoms them·
selues, in this he found the origin ol the power oi free move·
ment, and the source ol the sreedom oi the human will.
Epicurus, moreover, believed in gods; but he denied them all
concern in the changes oi things.² In ethics be differed from
the Cyrenaics regarding the nature ol happiness. He did not
limit it to acontinuance or succession ol pleasurable sensations,
but iound it also in perfect freedom oi the body from pain aud
the soul from care oranxiety. He thus recognized a negative
as well as positive side ol happiness. He eularged upon the
Cyrenaics' doctrine ol pleasure as the supreme good, and empha-
sized as much as they the rational pursuit oi it. The sage will
be a carelul reckoner oi pains and pleasures. All actions in
which the pains are going to predominate he will reiraiu irom3
all which involve the more pleasure he will engage iu. The
remaining doctrines oi Epicurus may be best considered in

discussiug the presentation of his philosophy by Lucretius.
