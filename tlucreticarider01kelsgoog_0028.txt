aim at happiness; yet this should be sought in pleasure not of
the body but oi the soul. Wisdom brings sels—mastery3 without
it lite lacks enjoyments‚ death’s terrors appall. Ignorance is
the source of all taults.1 For him that wants little a little

is the almost universal testimony oi antiquity that the philoso-

With Socrates came a change in the bend of Greek thought.
Cicero says ot him that ‘he called philosophy down from heaven,
and made her to dwell in cities, and brought her even to men’s
houses‚ and caused her to make inquiry about life and character
and things good and evil.'⁴ The attention oi philosophers was
now directed not so much to the problem oi the universe as to
that ot man, to settling the vexed questions of human lite. But
Socrates was too broad a man to be fully comprehended by his

generation. Most of the schools that owed their originative
q impulse to his teachings reflected these only partially and im·
persectly. Two in particular, the Cynic and the Cyrenaic,
grasped each but a single phase of doctrine, and made it alone

the basis of a system oi morals3 hence were developed two
ethical theories diametrically opposed to each other. Socrates
taught the intimate relation between virtue and happiness. He
enjoined the life of virtue, which he made to consist in actions
directed solely by reason under all circumstances; but he clearly
conceived as an aim to this only the happiness resulting there·
from. Antisthenes and the Cynics expanded the virtue-aspect
oi the teaching‚ and laid down a harsh rule ol actions, choking .
out utterly the influence of the feelings‚ and at the same time
imitating all that was rigid and repulsive in the Socratic life.
But Aristippus and the Cyrenaics emphasized the doctrine oi
happiness, making happiness the sole aim oi life, pleasure the
