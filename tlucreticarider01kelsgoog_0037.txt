LUCRETIUS As A PHILOSOPHER xxxi

In the spaces between the worlds the gods duell. Their
bodies are of the most subtile matter. They have nothing to do
with the ori-going ot things or the lile of men; they enjoy
peace that can never be disturbed, bliss incapable of increase.
and unending.1 The present order oi things is too full of im·
perlection to admit oi divine workmanship3 and the gods, even
if able to make the world, could have had no motive to t'rouble
themselves with creating‚ nor model to work from. There is no
divine power in the universe, no shaping and directing mind.²
There is no design in the present order oi things. All results
from the chance concurrence oi atoms moving from eternity in
infinite space.8 Nothing exists but something exactly like it in
the past was, or in the present is, or in the future shall be3 lor
in the infinity oi time and space like conditions will be repeated,
like results follow. Perhaps the matter that now makes up our
body and soul in iar distant time may just as now be gathered
and united in a breathing form ; yet that will not be the pres·
ent seli, since the thread oi personal identity will have been
broken.⁴

Nevertheless, the chance that presides over the genesis and
dissolution of all things is not mere accident. There is a fixed
order in things. Lucretius well illustrates the legal trend oi the
Roman mind; he grasped the unity and harmony that underlie
all natural processes much more clearly than his master. No
one ever held more firmly that nothing can happen without
cause. Behind the proximate he is ever see'lring the ultimate.
To him the universe is the manifestation of eternal change

under the reign oi law. This is why he rejects with so bitter
scorn the paltry gods ol the mythology. Pitiable creatores they
were, each with his circumscribed sphere oi activity‚ dividing
the universe up into so many parts, and all the time wrangling
about trenching on each other's prerogatives, sporting with
natural forces, lull oi jealousies and biclrerings! To Lucretius,
