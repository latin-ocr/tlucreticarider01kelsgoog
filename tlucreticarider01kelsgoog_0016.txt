age at lorty-four at the time ol death, he was born late in n. c.
99 or in the earlier part os 98.

The name Lucretius was famous in Roman annals from an
early date. The stock‚ or family, to which it belonged was
' primarily patrician, but in the poet's day had at least three ple-
beian branclreS, all of good standing, with the surnames Gallus,
Ofella, and Vespillo. It is known from coins that there was a .

Lucretius Trio, who was probably ol plebeian parentage. The
patriciau Lucretii had the sumame Tricipitini, but gave to
history no distinguished character after the third century rac.
The name Carus is not found elsewhere coupled with Lucretius.l
But Titus, as Munro has noticed,² was a not infrequent praeno-
men among the Lucretii Tricipitini3 this slight clue perhaps
makes it probable that from them the poet sprung. That his

rank was high is evident srom the poem itseli. He was thor·
oughly imbued with the culture ol the time3 and education was
-then a boon in the reach only of the upper classes. ln his dedi-
cation he addresses the well-known and influential Memmius
as friend and equal ;8 not with the tone of inferior to patron, as
os Horace to Maecenas. Scenes oi luxury are familiar to him3
and he touches on them not with the air of a novice in high lile,
but of one who had always been iu the midst of elegant sur-
roundings.4 Regarding the circumstances of his education and
the moulding influences os his life, as we know absolutely noth·
ing, it is idle to speculate.

The story ol Lucretius' madness hasbeen much enlarged
upon, and has surrounded his name with a romantic halo.⁵
Possibly it is a myth, framed and circulated by those envious
oi his ability and hostile to his doctrine. At any rate, no men·
tion seems to have been made of it before the time ol SuetoniuS,
from whom doubtless Jerome drew his account.⁶ Indeed the
