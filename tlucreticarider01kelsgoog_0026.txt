ered as having existence equally with the iormer.¹ Matter is
made up oi particles which are invisible, underived, indivisible,'
impenetrable‚ imperishablc,—the atoms. These are all alilre
in nature, and ol the same specific gravity. They differ iu
torm, being of numberless shapes; hence also in siae and
weight. They are distinguished, moreover, by differences in
arrangement, or order, and position. They are the changeless
substrate underlying everything. The atoms are always mov-
iug; their natural movemeut is downward in straight lines, be·
cause oi their weight. All things are made up oi combinations
oi atoms. In every combination there is void, as only the
atoms are periectly solid. Things undergo change by the shift·
ing about of atoms in different order and relative positions. ,
The various qualities that are perceived in things are not prop
erties oi the aiom, hut accidental properties of the combination.
Life thus is an accident of certain atom groups. There are four
combinations oi special permanency and importatum, inasmuch
as they are wrought into many others-tire, air, water, and
earth.²

As space is unlimited and atoms are numberless‚ there is au
infinite number oi worlds. These are all the time coming into
existence, dissolving back into atoms. As the atoms tall in
infinite space the heavier go faster than the lighter, impinging
upon them; these are forced upward and sidewise, get entanglcd
because of the different shapes‚ and form thus a mass to which
the composition of motions gives a rotary movement. The mass
receives constant additions as it. goes whirling through the
cloud of falling particles, and intime a world is produced. This
result happens hy the law oi necessity. From such a combina-
tion our world came. As the atoms settled together the lighter
were forced out. The lightest formed a close enveloping cir-
cumference‚ or sphere; those oi more wcight, the heavenly
bodies, which caught fire srom moving in the air, itseli composed
